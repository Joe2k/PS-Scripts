In our first project,\nwe first tried finding defocus map using basic image processing techniques such as edge\n41\n\ndetection using Sobel operator and Laplacian operator continued with some advanced image\nprocessing techniques such as canny edge detector. Since plain edge detection techniques are\nnot giving good results, we turned to machine learning models such as holistic edge detector.\nEdge detectors are giving good results when the defocused part of the image has very less\nvariation in intensities. As we know that this will not be the case for every image, we want to find\ndefocus map by finding the function/ kernel that is causing the defocus. And also, we are using\nsome deep learning models ( advanced models of CNNs) to find the defocus map. For the\nsecond project, we built a crop tool that automatically crops an image with the user given aspect\nratio while maintaining the image composition and aesthetics. We combined a neural network\narchitecture and an optimisation module to maintain the image composition and aesthetics. This\ntool is designed to combine with export workflow of LrClassic so that it would significantly\ndecrease the time spent by user while exporting batches of images\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Jupyter Notebook, Lightroom, SQLite,Plotly\nObjectives of the project : Object Homogeneous Defocus Map Estimation and Automatic Crop\nfor Export Workflow\nMajor Learning Outcomes : I had to explore different architectures for the model to recognize\nthe region of interest and experiment on it.

I took upon the project to\nautomate this entire exercise. The model automatically updates the pivot tables, runs the\nmacros and converts the data into a consumable format.\nThe entire process has become much more efficient owing to the robustness of the model. The\nautomation of this reporting process has led to devoting more time on other productive activities\nsuch as conducting deep dives and more thorough analysis.\nWhen the leadership and management set the targets for the Private Brand kitchens, they do so\nat a month level.

In development process, prorotypes were built and tested to make sure all\nthe customer requirements are statisfied. These prototypes were built in a way such that sub-\nassemblies   can   be   varied   for   producing   desirable   Damping   force   in   the   damper   (Shock\nabsorber). Piston sub-assembly is one of such sub-assemblies. In Piston sub-assembly, valve\nstacks will be located on both sides. These are made up of shim discs, orifice discs.\nIn development process, during testing phase, Damping force is generated by varying valve\nstacks, etc... that too in trail and error fashion. Because of this time taken to fine tune damper\nwill be long. To reduce this time taking process, they initiated an application such that damping\nforce can be generated for a given set of valve stack properties with a fixed shock absorber\noutline.\nIn this application,\nStage-I :\nIndentification deflection of valve stack with respective to velocity of piston rod in damper.\nStage-II :\nKeeping deflection of stack as input, Stiffness of the stack can be calculated\nStage-III:\nNote: Damping force is nothing but resisting force offered by shim stack to oil flowing from one \nchamber to another chamber.\nKeeping stiffness as input, Damping force is calculated. A trend is generated for Damping force \nvs Velocity of piston rod.\nThis prediction of Damping force w.r.t. velocity of piston will make the NPD (new Product \nDevelopment) team take less time for appropriate valve stack.\nWe developed a MATLAB GUI with references from Ansys fluent work, which will predict the \ndeflection of the stack.\n156\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : MATLAB, Ansys (Structural & Fluent), Excel \nsheets, CATIA V5\nObjectives of the project : Prediction of deflection of pyramid shim stack\nMajor Learning Outcomes : 1.

The project was a full stack learning experience.\nThere was development and ingenuity involved in making the workflow, some automations to\nmake life easier and a bit of testing too.\nIn the end, I got to setup an actual data-center using the package that I made. It was a good\nexperience where I learned valuable skills for working in an IT industry as well as an ignoble\ncomfortable lifestyle. The important lesson is difference between the code of an undergraduate\nand   an   IT   professional.   While   the   novice   can   do   away   with   concepts   of   abstraction,\nencapsulation and dump his code into a single file, the professional makes a well-listed code\nwith intricate file dependencies to ensure that these concepts are implemented.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Canaveral ,CircleCI, Git, PyCharm IDE\nObjectives of the project : Develop of client to bootstrap a new datacenter\nMajor Learning Outcomes : Professional way of writing code with emphasis on concepts like\nabstraction, encapsulation and linting .\nDetails of Papers/patents :\nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company : Free food that\ncan give a four star hotel, a run for its money, re-imbursement for cabs, flights are few of the\nattractive benefits that lure in employees from elite companies like Amazon and Oracle. Nutanix\nis like the horn of Cornucopia when it comes to the welfare of employees.\nWorking environment depends on your team. Fortunately for me, my mentor was a kind man.\nHe guided me through the whole project with unfaltering enthusiasm.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Computer Networks, OOP"

Semiconductor industry\nneeds tools which use machine learning and big data to predict yields, faults, reliability, aging\ncurves, etc for electronic circuits even before they are even fabricated so as to decrease time-\nto-market speed. I had a privilege of working on beta versions of two such tools, running various\ntest cases on them (for doing process/statistical variation) and providing feedback so as to\nfurther improve these tools. One of tool after the evaluation presented by me was purchased the\ncompany while the others purchase was delayed as it did not bring the value for money and\nperformance enhancement as expected by the company.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Virtuoso, Custom Compiler, Eldo, Spectre,\nHspice, Wicked, Calibre, etc.\nObjectives of the project : Objective of my training was to improvise the methodologies used\nfor yield analysis through pre and post layout simulations (which included verification and\nstatistical/process variation), in order to meet the time-to-market with reasonable accuracy. Also\nMajor Learning Outcomes : I learnt about the state of art technologies like FD/PD-SOI (their\ndesign, advantages, limitations & future scope) used in the semiconductor industry at present.\nThen I also had a familiarization with the various EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.\n371\n\nDetails of Papers/patents :\nBrief   Description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company  :   Work\nenvironment is quite good. People are always ready to help, one gets a great exposure by\nknowing   about   the   recent   trends   in   the   industry   and   new   technologies   that   are   under\ndevelopment. There is little difference in the work given and result expected from interns and\nemployees, which I suppose makes this a great place to grow professionally.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project  : Electronic Devices, Microelectronic Circuits,\nDigital Design, Analog Electronics."
