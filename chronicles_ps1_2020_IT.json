Field images from ESA's Sentinel 2-B \nsatellite  were  for  this  project.  The  very  large  images  were  broken  down  into  grids  and \nthe vegetative index was found to make boundaries visible.  The boundaries were hand-\ndrawn to make masks which would then be fed to the ML model. Any ML model could \nbe chosen and we decided upon the UNet Model. \nI  had  changed my  project  mid-way  as  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  ML  knowledge  required \nfor this. My new project was Enhanced Image Steganography. In this, messages have \nto embed into any image in a lossless format such as png with no noticeable alteration. \nWe did this by altering the LSB of RGB values of each pixel in an image using python to \nembed  the  message  which  had  been  converted  to  binary.  Later  the  message  can  be \ndecoded  using  another  python  script  where  the  process  is  reversed  to  recover  the \nmessage  hidden  in  the  image.  Upon  submitting  this,  various  methods  to  improve  this \nprocess using advanced encryption techniques was researched upon.  \nWhile doing the above, various group discussions were also held on current affair topics \nwhile  quizzes  where  conducted  upon  material  given  by  our  BITS  mentor,  which  in  my \ncase was on entrepreneurship. In the end, we had to present our program and submit a \nreport on it. \n\n32 \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The remote  PS  experience  can  be  described  as  self-study  with \nguidance.  The  project  requirements  and  general  direction  to  be  taken  is  given  by  the \nmentors  while  the  technical  requirements  for  implementation  must  be  acquired  on  our \nown  giving  a  feeling  of  freelancing.  The  group  discussions  and  presentation  give  a \nunique experience where you have to talk and show a presentation while not being able \nto  see  anyone's  expression.  Splitting  of  work  among  members  can  be  challenging  at \nfirst but once everyone achieves the same pace, it proceeds smoothly. Dedicating time \nto  sit  in  a  place  and  work  while  being  at  home  was  also  a  challenge  in  the  beginning \nand  I  had  to  learn  to  build  up  my  mental  strength  to  overcome  laziness  and  boredom \ndue to sitting in front of a screen for long hours. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : In  the  technical  aspect,  I  learnt  python  programming,  basics  of \nML,  image  processing  and  scrapping  all from  scratch. The  basics  of  cryptography  and \nsteganography was explained by my mentor through various research papers. \nIn  the  soft  skills  aspect,  learning  to  search  for  and  read  research  papers,  presenting \nyour model remotely, writing a formal project report, writing formal emails requesting for \nassistance,  team  work  and  coordination  among  various  members,  learning to  settle \ndisputes over the project and learning to speak remotely over a microphone are the my \nmain learning outcome out of this PS. \n \n \n------------"

There  were  hardly  any  difficulties  even \nthough we were working from our home. The group members were quite supportive of \neach other and I enjoyed a lot while working on the project. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  mainly  learned  web  development  which  is  not  a  part  of  our \ncourse until now.

To  accomplish,  we  divided  our  team  into  two \nfor focusing on the Frontend and Backend Parts of the website. We used HTML, CSS, \nBootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend and NodeJS and Express for the backend. A \nlot  of  Node  packages  like  PassportJS,  Bcrypt,  nodemon,  dotenv  etc  was  also  used \nwhile developing the frontend. The Frontend was fairly easy to create. The difficult part \nwas  the  backend  when  we  were  dealing  with  encryption,  privacy  and  authorization. \nAnother point of debate was whether to store the files in a File System or a Database. \nWe  also  had  minor  discussions  on  SQL  vs  No-SQL  Databases  and  in  the  end,  we \nchose   MySQL   as   our   Database   for   the   stack.

In short this project summarizes how \nexactly the Internet of Things can accomplish this dream of humans. The project was to \nmonitor  the  real  time  temperature  and  humidity  of  a  room  which  can  be  remotely \nlocated,  on  our  own  web  site.  The  purpose  was  served  by  using  a  temperature  and  a \nhumidity sensor which are electronic devices capable of sensing temperature and water \nvapour  content  from  the  surrounding  air  and  responding  by  providing  output  analog \nsignals  generated  due  to  varying  output  voltages  based  on  the  changes  in  the \nsurrounding  parameters.  The  sensors  were  connected  to  an  external  hardware  known \nas  an  IoT  board  having  the  capability  to  connect  to  a  network  and  a  programming \ndevice  using  wireless  or  wired  connectivity.  I  used  the  most  popular  microcontroller \nbased board i.e. Node-MCU or ESP8266. The rest of the project dealt with the use of a \nnetwork  such  as  an  Internet  or  an  intranet  where  this  IoT  device  was  made  a  client \nsimply using libraries included in the Arduino IDE software. The client was then allowed \nto  request  the  database  such  as  the  Google  Firebase,  to  store  this  real  time  sensor \n\n52 \n \nreadings. The web browser client then simply requests this data from the IoT cloud and \ndisplays it. The same client-server communication was used to make an android app for \ndisplaying the same real time readings. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  was  all  together  fascinating  and  the  challenges  we \nfaced  due  to  the  covid-19  situation  added  up  to  the  learning  experience.

Object  detection  is  a \ncomputer-vision  task involving  detecting  instances  of  objects  of  a  certain  class(e.g. \nhumans, cars, etc.) from images or videos. Jetson Nano is a small, powerful computer \nmanufactured by NVIDIA and is used for embedded applications. The project aimed to \nhave vehicle detection work at 20+ FPS on Jetson Nano. Due to the memory and speed \nconstraints,  we  couldn't  choose  the  state of  the  art object  detection  models  like  YOLO \nv4, Faster RCNN. Instead, we chose the models SSD Mobilenet v2 and Tiny YOLO v3 \nwhich  could  work  in  the  constrained  environment  of  Jetson  Nano.  This  project  was \nassigned  to  1  other  student,  so  we  each  chose  a  model  to  work  with.  First,  we \npreprocessed the dataset which included cleaning, splitting and creating records. Then, \nwe  custom  trained  our  models  on  this  dataset.  Following  this,  we  tested  the  model  on \ntest images and evaluated the accuracy. Then we created an end to end ML pipeline for \n\n62 \n \ndetection  of  cars  in  videos  and  live  video  feed from a  webcam.  After  this,  we  installed \nthe required libraries, set up the environment and deployed both the models on Jetson \nNano.  Finally,  I  optimized  the  existing  SSD  model  with  TensorRT  and  multithreading \nwhich  gave  an  inference  speed  of  31  FPS  on  Jetson  Nano.  Additionally, we  also \ncreated a Flask API to deploy the working model on a local server. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  was  awesome.  To  start  with,  we  were  allowed  to \nchoose from 6 projects and there were 5 of us. All the projects were great. The projects \nwere related to HPC and ML. We started working from the first week itself. My mentor \nwas very helpful and gave us ample time to work on each aspect of the project. Due to \nthe  remote mode  of  operation,  we  had meetings  with  him  twice  a week  and  we  asked \ndoubts and discussed any problems on WhatsApp. He was always ready to help us and \nmade  sure that  we  were  working  ahead  of the  decided  timeline  of  the project. Our  PS \ninstructor was great too, he kept weekly meetings to get updates from us and organized \nthe  evaluative  components  very  well.    I  couldn't  have  wished  for  any  better  working \nenvironment than this for PS-I. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  learnt  the  basics  of  deep  learning  and  convolutional  neural \nnetworks. I am now able to work with the basic libraries in Python like NumPy, OpenCV, \nMatplotlib, seaborn and frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Tensorboard, Darknet used \nfor deep learning. I learnt about the various object detection algorithms like YOLO, SSD \nand  got  to  explore  a  lot  of  different  versions  and  pre-trained  models of  these  two \nalgorithms. I got to work on NVIDIA's Jetson Nano and understood its advantages and \nlimitations.  I  understood  the  different  optimization  techniques  using  TensorRT  to \nimprove the performance of a model. I also learnt to create basic web APIs using Flask. \n \n \n------------"

Elixar Systems is a BITSian start-up working in the field of \nAugemented  Reality  (AR)  to  improve  education  in  India  and  abroad.  The  platform  I \nhelped create  from  scratch  is  called  'Aerth',  and  it  can  be  briefly  described  as  a \nproprietary  GitHub  for  AR  Development.  I  worked  mainly  on  the  backend  part  of  the \nplatform. \nThe Aerth platform is a place for all the AR developers associated with Elixar Systems \nto find and apply to new projects and work on them. They can upload all kind of files for \ntheir projects, receive stipend, find existing code, and interact with other developers and \nadministrators at Elixar Systems. Meanwhile, the admins at Elixar Systems get a place \nwhere they can manage all their projects and developers together and in an organized \nand seamless manner. \nI  used  Django  to  build  the  backend  of the  website and a  MySQL  database to  store  all \nthe data.

Since \nthe consignment moves through a number of hands, it is generally impossible to figure \nout  the  entity  responsible  for  the  damage  and  hence  insurance  isn't  assured.  Using \nblockchain  ensured  the  immutability  of  data  hence  preventing  any  tampering  of  the \nsame. It made sure various parties involved in the shipment process have a consensus \nby  the  signing  of  a  Smart  Contract  that  uses  blockchain.  Moreover,  since  high-value \nconsignments may have a number of physical requirements like proper temperature and \nhumidity, we used IoT technology to allow sensors to measure a threshold of values. To \nimplement  this,  we  developed  a  web  application  for  creating  and  tracking  shipments \nalong  with  passing  on  handover  requests  using  MERN  stack  for  the  web  development \nand AWS for its Blockchain and IoT services.

The project was \nquite  interesting  as  we  realized  that a  large number of  shipping  companies  incur  huge \nlosses  every  year  due  to tampering  and  damage  to high-value  consignments, and  it  is \ngenerally impossible to figure out the entity responsible for the damage. We devised the \nuse  cases  for  the  problem  and  determined  the  parties  that  will  be  participating  in  the \nshipment  process  like  the  consignment  receiver  and  shipper,  logistics and  insurance \nprovider,  vehicle  operator  and  so  on.  Then,  we  developed  a  user  interface  that \nfacilitates a smooth user experience. After a successful integration of the front-end and \nback-end modules, we progressed towards the final stage of the project, i.e., simulating \nthe IoT devices and integrating the Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the system. We \nused the AWS IoT and AWS Lambda for the simulation process. AWS Lambda helped \nus  to  elastically  generate  device  sensors  that  report  their  state  tot  he  AWS  cloud.  To \nstore the IoT readings from the sensor, we used Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. \nFurther, Amazon Managed Blockchain was an important component of our project as it \nmade  our  work  easier  to  create  and  manage  a  scalable  blockchain  network  using  the \npopular  open  source  frameworks  Hyperledger  Fabric  and  Ethereum.  Finally,  we  were \nable to come up with a solution to the frequently-faced problem in the shipping industry. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Due to the online mode of training, many of us were skeptical about \nthe efficiency of the system. But for me, it worked very well. PS-1 was well organized by \nthe institute and provided us with a great industrial experience. I believe that working on \na project at Happiest Minds was a great opportunity for me to make a good start in the \nindustrial  project  experience.  The  projects  at  Happiest  Minds  were  very  interesting  to \nwork  on  as  they  leverage  a  spectrum  of  technologies  like  CoE  Analytics,  IoT,  AI  & \nCognitive Computing, Blockchain, etc. \nAlong  with  the  interesting  projects provided by  Happiest  Minds, I believe  that  having  a \ngreat  learning  experience  at  Happiest  Minds  could not have  been possible  without  the \ncombined  effort  by  the  team  and  most  importantly,  the  mentors  who  supported  and \nencouraged  us  at  every  point  through  this industrial  project.  Despite  being  busy  with \ntheir  own  responsibilities  and  other  projects  at  Happiest  Minds,  they  managed  to  take \nout  time  to  help  and  guide  us  by  providing  their  valuable  inputs.  As  far  as  team \nmembers  are  concerned,  all  have  been  very  cooperative  with  each  other.  All my  team \nmembers  were  reliable,  trustworthy,  and  consistent  in  their  approach,  which  led  to  the \nteam to progress in the right direction.  \nI  truly  appreciate  the  efforts  taken  by  everybody,  including  my  PS  instructor  who  was \nthere  to  help  at  every  point  where  I  was  stuck.  She  coordinated  really  well  with  the \ncompany  professionals  and  mentors  to  make  the  hands-on  experience  of  working  on \nthe industrial project a fruitful one. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : Being a second-year dual-degree student, I had a little experience \nin programming at the time of the PS project. The most important learning outcome from \n\n103 \n \nthe PS-1  experience for  me  is that  you  can implement anything  you  wish  by  putting  in \nconstant  efforts.  The  technologies  that  we  used  in the  project  were  completely  new  to \nme,  but  the  approach  that  I  had  to  deal  with  the  problems  to  complete  the  assigned \ntasks helped me to become a better learner. \nThe second learning outcome which I believe is very valuable to me is the inspiration I \ntook  from  the  mentors  at  Happiest  Minds.  Their  way  to  approach  problems  and \nmanaging  the  team  was  something  that  I  want  to  inculcate  in  my  attitude.  They  have \nmade me learn to incorporate different aspects of a problem and to constantly work on \nthe optimization part of the developed project. \n \n \n------------"

The  director  of  the  company  instructed  us  to  attend  daily \ntraining sessions from 9:30 am to 1 pm which was taken by a person from the company. \nIn  the first  week  we  were  taught  the  building  blocks  of  UI  development  namely  HTML, \nCSS, Bootsrtap4 and Javascript along  with topics like fetching data from remote APIs, \nhow  to  build  Progressive  Web  Apps  and  responsive  web  designing.  Day-to-day \nassignments were given based on the topics taught and we were supposed to present it \nto everyone on the very next day. I had some prior knowledge in this area so found the \ntasks  pretty  simple  but  it  will  take  really  good  efforts    if  you  are  new  to  this  as  they \nexpect  us  to  grasp  the  key  concepts  very  quickly  and  bring  it  to  application  as  well. \nFrom the second week onwards, we were introduced to git and the basic commands for \npushing and pulling code from remote repositories as we were expected to collaborate \nand work on the project as a team. As the product's requirement for the frontend User \nInterface was Angular framework, we were introduced to Typescript and then went on to \nbuild small applications in Angular. The training phase was pretty good where we were \ntaught the basics as well as some intermediate concepts in Angular and that helped us \nin the project phase. In the third week we were split into teams of 4 and each team was \nassigned  a  problem  statement  along  with  a  mentor  to  guide  them  if  they  face  any \ndifficulty related to the tasks. We had to give updates about our everyday contributions \nto  the  project to  our  mentor  in  the evening  and  a final  demo of  the  problem  statement \nwas  given to the director of the company where he suggested the changes that should \n\n108 \n \nbe  made  in  the  UI  screens.  After  the  demo  we  were  given  some  time  to  rectify  the \nissues  and  were  asked  to  submit  a  documentation  of  the  problem  statement.  With  a \nsecond problem statement being more challenging compared to to the first one,  I really \ngot  to  learn  a  lot  from  other  members  of  my  team.  At  the  start  things  seemed  to  be \nconfusing  but  slowly  we  got  accquainted  with  the  process  and made  significant \ncontributions to the project. Overall it was a very enriching experience for me as it gave \nconfidence to work on further projects in this domain. It took a lot of effort to complete \nthe  project  and  meet  the  deadlines  but  ultimately  it  gave me  a  glimpse  of  how \nproduction level code is written ,maintained and further developed. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : Learnt  frontend  web  development  using  Angular  framework  and \nintegrating  with  google  graphs.  Working  with  git  and  bitbucket  as  version  control \nsystems for the source code of the project \n \n \n------------"

The  COOOL  STEM  Games  or  the  MetaStudio  platform  is  a \nCollaborative  Open  Online  and  Ongoing  Learning  discussion  forum  which  enables \nproject-based    learning    to    encourage    Science,    Technology,    Engineering    and \nMathematics (STEM) education and to inculcate STEM habits in people.  \nThe  idea  was  to  build  a  responsive  and  progressive  web  app  that  is  functionally  the \nsame to the MetaStudio platform while at the same time being parsimonious in resource \n(network  and  storage)  usage.  The  project  aims  to  expand  the  horizons  of  STEM \nlearning by making it accessible to people with very slow internet connectivity in a vast \ncountry like India.  \nThe project domain was web development with a 'mobile first' approach. I had to work in \nareas  like  frontend  (HTML,  CSS,  JavaScript),  backend  (Node.js  and Express.js), \ntemplating with EJS, required an understanding of privacy, cookies, sessions, hashing, \nnetworks  and  various protocols  used  to  communicate  and  the  way  data  is  sent  across \nnetworks  as  XML  or  JSON,  understanding  API  documentation and  sometimes  reverse \nengineering it through network logs of MetaStudio website and using service worker to \ndeliver pages offline by caching them. \nOur team succeeded in making the desired app with 98% less resource usage and 50% \nfaster loading speed. At the end of six weeks, we were able to launch the app for public \nbeta testing. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: PS1  has  provided  me  with  the  opportunity  to  work  at  a  premier \nresearch  institute  HBCSE,  Mumbai.  This  allowed  me  to  interact  with  experienced  and \nknowledgeable mentors while collaborating with talented peers. The mentors were very \nfriendly and cordial, they rather wanted us to call them by their name and drop 'sir' . The \nwork  environment  was  amazing  with  flexible  timings  and  no  hard  and  strict  deadlines. \nOur  team  was  allowed  to  make  the  web  app  the  way  we  wanted  with  minimal \nintervention  from  the  mentors.  They  guided  us  when  we  got  stuck  while  using  the \nextensive API.  \nThe PS not only allowed me to gain exciting technical skills but we were able to gain a \nlot  of  soft  skills  as  well.  I  got  introduced  to  the  systematic  process  of  Software \ndevelopment through an exciting and vast world of Web Development. We understood \nhow client needs are taken into account while building a software and how to adapt to \nnew  changes  in  the  client  needs based  on  its  feasibility.  Collaboration  is  the  key  to \nSoftware development process. This was learnt and used extensively by doing version \ncontrol by using Git on GitHub. Reading technical pages like documentation is important \nto  build  a  great  software  using  pre  built  APIs.  Understanding  the formalities  needed  to \nbuild  a  README  and  making  an  effective  documentation  of  my  own  work  is  essential \nand  was  learnt  through  PS1.  Testing  and  debugging  using  tools  and  test  cases  is  a \nsalient and underlying feature of all software and was included in this project too. PS1 \ntaught  us  the  art  of  addressing  client  needs,  managing  time  and  setting  achievable \ntargets.  Presenting  updates  and  reporting  for  meetings  helped  us  gain  important  soft \nskills which are needed to work in any domain in life. \n\n118 \n \nThe   evaluations   were   well   planned   and   strikingly   different   from   routine   course \nevaluations  as  they  not  only  focused  on  the  technical  aspect,  but  also  at  holistic \ndevelopment.  \nAt  the  end  of  six  weeks,  the  surprise  public  beta  testing  release  of  our  app  at  the \nvaledictory  function  made  us  very  happy  and  the  efforts  we  put  in  the  last  six  weeks \nseemed to be redeemed in the best possible way. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  have  gained  new  technical  knowledge  and  skills.  I  got  to  learn \nand  work  in the  domain  of  Web  Development  and  dived  deep  into  areas  like  frontend \n(HTML,  CSS,  JavaScript),  backend  (Node.js  and  Express.js),  templating  with  EJS, \nprivacy,   cookies,   sessions,  hashing,   networks,   understanding  API  documentation, \nsending JSON data, working with JSON Web Tokens and OAuth2 authentication. I got \ninsight into professional practices like working and collaborating in teams on GitHub. \nPS1  also  taught  us  the  art  of  addressing  client  needs,  managing  time  and  setting \nachievable   targets.   Updating   with weekly   plans,   presentations   and   reporting   for \nmeetings helped me gain important soft skills essential for working in any domain in life.   \nThe  real-life  problem  statement  of  making  a  STEM  discussion  forum  lighter  so  that  it \ncan  give  great  user  experience to  people  with  low  network  speeds  like  Jammu  and \nKashmir  made  me  realize  that  most  important    learning  was  understanding  the \nproblems society faces and finding solutions to make their life better. \n \n \n------------"

STEMGames  was  conceived  with  the  idea  of  an  experiential \npedagogy  towards  science  education,  backed  by  the  ideals  and  experience  of  Dr. \nNagarjuna  in the  same  field.  STEMGames  seeks  to  inculcate  \"STEMhabits\"  and  a \nlasting avidity for scientific knowledge while achieving meaningful creations made by the \nparticipants themselves. The idea \nwas to build a responsive and progressive web app that is functionally the same to the \nmetastudio  platform  while  at  the  same  time  being  parsimonious  in  resource  (network \nand  storage)  usage.  It  wishes  to  expand  the  horizons  of  STEM  learning  by  making  it \naccessible to people with very slow internet connectivity in a vast country like India. The \npreference  is  for  User  experience  (UX),  speed  and  ease  of  use,  or  the  ergonomic \ndesign instead of a cluttered, overburdened, and slow website. The aim was to generate \na  client  to  work  with  the  present  API  while  supporting  a  cross-platform  and  mobile-\nfriendly User Interface (UI). The website had to be built with a mobile-first approach. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: This  was  a  new  and  enriching  experience  for  me.  I  have  never \nworked in the field of web development before and there were a lot of new things I had \nto  learn  before  I  could  get  started  on  making  the  web  app  along  with  my  team.  For \ninstance,  I  have  never  worked  with  CSS  or  JavaScript  before.  I  might  also  add  that  it \nwas challenging at times, frustrating even. But therein lies the beauty that I have come \nto  associate  with  the  process  of  software  development.  It  has  its  ups  and  downs,  but \none has to learn to battle through it and push forward. Although it was a wfh PS, I was \nnot able to get any actual industry tour still the experience has been quite holistic. I have \nalso  learnt  a  great  deal  about  what  this  prestigious  institution  stands  for.  Science \nEducation.  I  am  glad  to  have  had  a  hand  in  bettering  the  process  and  in  doing  so, \nservice to society. \n \n\n120 \n \n \nLearning   Outcome : Learning   about   Web   Development   and   chronicling   and \ncollaborating on a project on Github. \n \n \n------------"

From the publicly available dataset \nof satellite images stored with Google, we learnt to fetch images and display them using \nvarious visualization techniques, converting numbers into images.  \nWe  also  did  Image  Classification,  where  we  trained  a  few  Machine  Learning  Models \nusing algorithms such as SVM, K-Means and SAM. These models were used to classify \npixels into different landcover types, like forests, water, soil etc. \nWe  will  further  use  these  classified  images  for  change  detection,  ie.  automatically \ndetecting change in landcover.  \nWe have integrated all these functions in a GUI to make our program user-friendly. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  went  into  PS-I  expecting  to  do  work  only  related  to  Machine \nLearning/Deep  Learning.  Though  the  project  was  related  to  these,  it  turns  out  that  all \nthese  ML  models  are  already  implemented  and  we  just  have  to  use  them.  Our  main \nwork  was  getting  to know  about  Google  Earth  Engine,  and  learning  how  to  fetch  and \nvisualize  data.  Further,  we  learnt  how  to  use  the  already  implemented  models,  also \nimplementing SAM classification from scratch. \nIn short, our work didn't use any of our knowledge of ML/DL. Instead, a majority of our \ntime was spent in image visualization and making the GUI. It also seemed as if we were \ndoing software development, not remote sensing,  which  was  very different than what I \nhad expected. \n \n\n132 \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt a lot about remote sensing as a field. I learnt how to use \nGoogle Earth Engine, and have started to appreciate the platform which makes remote \nsensing  a  lot  easier.  I  have  learnt  that  a  lot  of  work  related  to  ML/DL  doesn't  involve \nbuilding  models  from  scratch,  but  is  more concerned  about  how  to  fine-tune  these \nmodels according to your needs, and also to integrate them in your application.  \nI learnt a bit about how industry-grade code should look like. When multiple people are \nworking on a project, the code should be properly commented and documented so that \nanyone can understand it. \n \n \n------------"

The first stage was to compare \nthe  heights  of  two  clouds  from  their  IR  image.  So  I  applied  the  threshold  function  of \nOpenCV here which separated clouds with a low height from clouds with high height. I \nused  concepts  of  Stefan-Boltzmann  law  and  Lapse  rate  in  this  separation.  I  also  tried \nTherimage  packages  from  R  language  of  separation  which  helped  in  separation  by \nplotting images with different palettes. After this, we needed to automate our model and \nalso find the absolute value of the height of the cloud. For automation, a cloud detector \nwas  needed.  I  used  contour  plotting  of  OpenCV  which  detect  clouds  using  edge \ndetection and plots a rectangle around it which it cropped later. Now we need to find the \naverage  temperature  of  the  cloud  detected  from  the  contour.  For  this  first,  I  stored  all \npixel  values  with  its  temperature  in  dictionary  extracted  from  the  color  bar  of  the  IR \nimage. Then I moved to every pixel of the cropped out image of the cloud and searched \nfor its corresponding temperature in the dictionary and took the average temperature of \nall the pixels of the cloud. And finally using dry lapse rate I calculated the height of the \ncloud.  This  method  of  cloud  height  detection  is  fast  and  cheap  as  compared  to  the \ncurrent method used by IMD in cloud height detection. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  got  to  learn  various  skills  due  to  PS1.  Our  instructor  helped  us  to \nlearn  all  the  skills  from  the  beginning  and  to  get  ideas  for  the  progress  of  our  project. \nOur instructor conducted daily meetings to solve our doubts and guide us for further on. \nOur Instructor regularly contacted IMD mentors to help us in our project and sharing our \n\n142 \n \nprogress. He  divided  us  into  a  group  of  2-4  students  based  on  our  streams.  Our \ninstructor  shared  many  tutorial  videos  and  text  so  as  to  introduce  us  to  various  topics \nwhich would be needed in our project. These tutorials were very nice and guided us to \nvarious  topics  which  could  be  further  explored  from  various  tutorials  available  on  the \ninternet.  Honestly,  at  the  beginning  of    PS1  I  was  having  zero  knowledge  about  these \nskills and topics but after completion of PS, I having good knowledge of these skills with \nexperience which I gained in doing these projects. \n \n \n \nLearning Outcome : In these 6 weeks of PS1, I gained various skills. My project in PS \n1 was based on calculating cloud height using image processing of IR images of clouds \nclicked  from  the  earth.  Before  starting  the  project,  some  prerequisites  were  needed  to \nbe completed so as to ensure a proper understanding of the project and generate ideas \nfor the project. The first and most important skill required to gain before the start of the \nproject  was  understanding image  processing  theory  and  various  tools  used  in  it.  After \nthis,  I  learned  Deep  Learning  (especially  Convolutional  Neural  Networks)  concepts \nwhich are also important for the automation of our project work. After the completion of \nall  the  theory  part  of  image  processing  and  deep  learning,  I  felt  a  great  need  for \napplying  these  concepts  practically.  So  I  worked  on  some  algorithms  of  Convolutional \nNeural   Networks   on   Google   Colab   notebook,   some   of   these   algorithms   include \n(handwritten  digits  detection  and  cat and  dog  detection).  And  for  Image  processing,  I \nchoose OpenCV libraries of Python. I worked on many image processing tools like Edge \ndetection, haar-cascade and contour plotting on OpenCV. I also tried the YOLO object \ndetection library and R-thermimage packages. \n \n \n------------"

We \ncoordinated with our mentors at NIC from time to time using Google Meet and updated \nthem about our progress. They guided us and sometimes suggested modifications. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : We learnt new languages like GoLang, JavaScript etc. and learnt \nhow the blockchain functions. Furthermore, we extensively studied Hyperledger Fabric, \nupon which our project network  was deployed. We made a front-end for the student & \nthe  Admin,  a  blockchain  back-end  and  an  API  to  connect  the  two.  At  every  stage  the \nwork  was  divided  among  teammates.  Our  instructor  took  seminars  and  we  also \nparticipated in a group discussion. \n \n \n------------"

There  are  a  number  of  things  that  are \ninvolved in doing a market study. So we did Qualitative analysis as well as Quantitative \nanalysis.Under Qualitative analysis we took the competitors of PayPal and found out as \nto what all services are offered by PayPal and others, which all are the areas that need \nto be improved upon.On similar lines, Qualitative analysis was further done using three \nbenchmark  techniques  namely  SWOT  analysis,  PEST  analysis,  Porter's  Five  Forces \nanalysis  of  the  digital  wallet  industry  in  India.Quantitative  analysis  was  done  studying \nthe behavior of the consumer under two categories - those using PayPal and those who \nuse some other mode.The variables included frequency of purchases, amount, etc. We \nalso made a web-page where different graphs could be found as soon as we input the \ndata of PayPal or other competitors with and without time being taken as a frame. This \nwas  done  for  a  better  Quantitative  analysis  that  could  also  compare  PayPal  with  its \ncompetitors.

Before,  the  NGO  worked  using \nWhatsapp and word-of mouth.  \nWe used Zoho Creator (a low code platform for creating custom applications) to create \nan application  which  contained  forms  to  collect  data  like  donor  form,  beneficiary  form, \nvolunteer  form,  and  donation  page.  We  also  created  a  public  Dashboard  to    show \nstatistics about the donations made till date. \nFor  better  reach  we  also  created  an android  application  (using  Java)  which  will  collect \ndata  from  donor/beneficiary/volunteer  and  send  it  to  the  Zoho  application  using  API \ncalls.  The  android  app  also  features  a  dashboard  which  shows  all  the  donation \nstatistics. \nWe have automated the application to a certain extent which are as follows. Whenever \ndetails  are  submitted,  an  email  is  sent  to  the  user  about  his/her  submission.  The \napplication  checks  for  mandatory  fields,  valid  mobile  number,  valid  Aadhaar  card \nnumber, etc. Whenever  a  beneficiary  sends  a  request for  help,  an  email  is  sent  to  the \nadmin for verification of the request. The request for help is automatically closed when \nthe target amount of monetary help is reached. \nThe process flow is as follows. The beneficiary submits the request for help. The admin \nmay  check  and  verify  the  request  and  may  confirm  the  request.  If  the  request  is \nconfirmed  a  new  campaign  is  created  and  mail  is  sent  to  all  donor  about  the  new \ncampaign.  Donations  are  accepted  till  the  target  amount  is  reached.

Our mentor dr. Gaurav provided us with the .kml file \nwhich contained labels of the marked solar farms.With the help of google earth engine \nwe had to extract the geotiff image of the labels and then make the dataset required for \ntraining step.Before this we were provided with some resources which contained  similar \nkind of approach for the building segmentation and it helped us a lot in our project.The \ntools used by us in project were google colab,GEE etc.The project was done in python \nand  various  different  such  as  solaris,riotiler,super  mercado  for  the  preprocessing \npart.The model which we used for semantic segmentation   was UNET.In post analysis \nwe came to know that since our dataset was small and UNET also was small model our \naccuracy  was  very  less.So  we  used  some  techniques  such  as  data  agumentation  and \nwe  changed  our  training  model  to  deepLabv3+  which  was  developed  by  google  for \nsemantic segmentation.

Surveillance  of  these  solar  farms \nwould  help  in  providing better  monitoring  and  optimal  utilization  of  renewable  energy \nsources. The detection of sand dunes in a particular area gives a rough idea about the \ndrought  conditions,  overgrazing,  unsustainable  agricultural  practices,  etc.  We  used \nSemantic  Segmentation, which  is  a  technique  to  classify  each  pixel  of  an  image  into \ndifferent  groups.  We  were  given  the  labeling  of  Solar  farms  and  Sand  dunes  in  a  kml \nfile. We imported and processed satellite images of the same via Google Earth Engine. \nThe entire project was done in three phases - Pre-processing, Main segmentation, and \nPost-processing. Pre-processing involved in breaking the GeoTIFF Satellite images into \nsmall  tiles.  These  tiles  were  fed  into  a  deep  learning  model.  We  used  two  different \narchitectures to compare and contrast our results - UNet and DeepLabV3. DeepLabV3 \nproved  to  be  a  more  effective  model  with  an  accuracy  of  almost  70%.

First  we  did  Literature \nReview on the subject by reading some research papers. Then we choose a face image \ndataset  and  did  Exploratory  Data  Analysis  on  it  to  know  the  dataset  better.  Then  we \ntried  to  preprocess  the  images  for  input  in  the  model.

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up  \n \nShort Summary of work done : We developed an everyday medication reminder app \nas our PS1 project. For developing the app, we learnt java and android studio. The app \n\n232 \n \nwas  designed  keeping  in  mind  the  fact  that  in  today's fast  paced  world,  people  often \nforget  important  things.  Some  of  them  might  have  medical  issues  like  diabetes, \nhypertension,   autoimmune   disorders   and   so   on,   which   require   constant   periodic \nmedication  to  survive.  But  unfortunately,  due  to  multiple  reasons, we  often  find  that \npeople  forget  to  take  their  medication  because  they  are  in  a  rush  or  because  they \nsimply  don't  remember  with  all  sorts  of  things  on  their  mind.  Our  simple  app  sends  a \nreminder  to  the  user  at  the  specified  time  to  take  their  medication.  Some  medications \nmight  need  to  be  taken  daily.  Some  might  need  to  be  taken  weekly.  Our  app  has \nrepetition interval provision for that as well. Once the user clicks on the notification, they \nwill be taken back to the app where they can enter the pills they have consumed. This \nwill be used to keep track of the total number of pills consumed during the month as a \nmeasure of their regularity. It also has a reset button to reset the count of pills. The user \ncan also delete old reminders once their prescriptions have been updated. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Working  with  Tamil  Nadu  Health  System  Reforms  was  a  fantastic \nexperience  which  provided  me  with  a  lot  of  knowledge  about  how  the  industry  works \nand  how  everything  is  set  up  in  a  professional  environment.  The  people working  at \nTamil  Nadu  Health  System  Reforms  clearly  specified  what  they  expected  of  us.  The \nguidance  of  our  PS1  faculty  was  also  invaluable.  We  were  able  to  structure  a \nmethodical  plan  to  complete  the  project  and  meet  our  goals  within  the  specified  time \nlimit.  Every  week,  we  implemented  a  new  functionality  in  the  app,  tested  it  and  then \nstarted  implementing  a  new  functionality  the  next  week.  In  this  manner,  what  initially \nseemed  like  a  daunting  task,  was  turned  into  much  smaller  volumes  which  we  could \nhandle.  Overall,  it  was  a  great  opportunity  and  the  industry  exposure  received  will  be \nuseful forever. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : In  the  course  of  our  project,  we  learnt  how  to  make  apps  in \nandroid studio from scratch. We learnt java for the purpose of android studio and all the \nassociated   functionalities   necessary   for   building   android   apps.   We   learnt   about \ndesigning  the  front  end  which  the  user  actually  interacts  with  and  how  to  start  a  new \nactivity  and  transition  smoothly  from  one  activity  into  another.  We  also  learnt  about \nstoring  data permanently  in  android  using  a database and  about using  alarms  to  send \nnotifications at the specified time. \n \n \n------------"

Based  on  the \nhistorical data provided, we had to predict the value of wind speed 15 days in advance. \nEmphasis  was  given  on  improving  the  prediction  performance  to  cope  with  the \nrequirements of the energy markets.  \nThe  major  challenge  was  the  dynamic  nature  of  wind.  We  had  to  perform  a  lot  of \nanalysis  into  the  dataset  to  identify  if  it  was  standardized,  and  if  there  was  any \nseasonality  or  trend  present  in  the  data.  It  was  a  new  experience to  work  with  such  a \nlarge dataset. We even had to use Spark for a few data handling operations. The whole \ncoding  aspect  of  the  project  was  in  Python  language.  We  used  Jupyter  notebook  and \nGoogle COLAB.  \nWe proceeded to decompose the data into linear and non-linear series and handle each \npart  separately.  For  the  linear  part,  we  used  the  rolling  ARIMA  model  for  time  series \nanalysis. The non-linear part was handled by training neural networks. We tried different \nArtificial  Neural  Networks  like  Deep  NN,  Recursive  NN,  LSTM(Long  Short  Term \nMemory). \nFinally  we  combined  the  predictions  using  their  residues  and  model  ensembling \ntechniques. \nIn  six  week's  time,  we  could  complete  the  end-goal  of  our  project  and  we  submitted  a \nmodel  that  gives  a  decent  accuracy  of  84%  in predicting  the  wind  speed  15  days  in \nadvance. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The technical skills that I have learnt during this internship have made \nme fall in love  with the idea of data-driven solutions. May it be time series models like \nARIMA or deep neural networks like LSTM, I have certainly improved my knowledge of \nmachine learning and that too by actually implementing all these on a practical level!  \nThe mentors were extremely helpful and were always ready to give their perspective on \nany  problems  faced.  We  were  even  supervised  by  the  top-tier  officials  from  the \ncompany,  and  their  motivation  really  helped  me  stay  dedicated  throughout.  The  best \npart  was  that  many  of  the  top-tier  officials  of  the  company  are  BITS  Pilani  Alumni,  so \nthey were all very friendly and expected a lot from us. \n\n238 \n \nThe  projects  offered  were  interesting,  the  data  provided  was  extensive,  and  we  were \nencouraged to think on our own and come up with our own solutions and approaches. I \nwould say that TIBIL offers a highly conducive environment for someone who wants to \nlearn  and  explore  more  in  the  fields  of  Data  Analytics,  Machine  Learning  and  Data \nEngineering. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : Frameworks/Languages:  Python,  Tensorflow,  Spark,  Keras, \nPandas, Matplotlib, Scipy \n1.  I  gained an exposure  to forecasting  principles  in  general.  Forecasting  is  a  vast field \nexpanding from weather prediction to the stock market trend predictions.  \n2.  I  learnt  how  different  time  series  analysis  techniques  like  ARIMA  models  work,  and \nalso  implemented  them  on  real-world  data.  ARIMA  models  can  be  found  in  the \nstatsmodels library. \n3. I also got a chance to study and implement several neural network models like DNN, \nRNN, LSTM. I made use of Tensorflow, Keras and Scikit-learn for the implementations. \n4.  I  further  went  on  to  learn  how  to  ensemble  models  to  create  the  most  robust \nprediction model. \n \n \n------------"

Since none of the students admitted to this technology were familiar with it, \nthe first half of PS-I saw us researching and understanding the theory that Blockchain is \nbased  on.  We  had  to  look  into  and  fully  understand  the  now  famous  2009  Bitcoin \nWhitepaper from Satoshi nakamoto, followed by the Ethereum Whitepaper from Vitalik \nButerin.  Along  with  this  ,  we  looked  into  many  new  (well,  they  were  new  to  us) \ninteresting   topics   in   the   fields   of   cryptography,   distributed networking   and   data \ncompression.  \nIn  the  second  half  of  PS-I,  we  used  a  DLT  (Distributed  Legder  Technology)  platform \nnamed Corda to design a solution for the supply chain industry. We had to learn a lot of \ntheory  that  made  made  Corda  different  form  regular  Blockchain  technology  and  also \n\n254 \n \nlearn how to write code using their libraries and tools to implement our solution. We had \nabout a week to make ourselves fluent in the Kotlin programming language because the \nCorda library is written in that language. \nIn the end, we were able to make a simple application in the form of a very basic supply \nchain management solution. \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS-I was a great experience overall.  \nI learnt a lot of things while working on our project, both in terms of soft skills as well as \ntechnical  skills.  When  it  comes  to  soft  skills,  my  teamwork  and  leadership  skills  were \nobviously  challenged.  For  one,  we  were  supposed  to  collaborate  with  students  from \nother campuses, who we had never met before. Getting to know them enough to work \neffectively  with  them  was  a  challenge  we  all  were  able  to  overcome.  We  learnt  each \nothers  coding  styles  and  how  each  of  us  thought  and  understood  different  things \ndifferently.  \nAs far as technical skills are concerned, everything that we did was new to us so almost \nall of the knowledge that we were able to soak in and retain is all really a technical skill \nboost.  We  learn  a  new  programming  language  and  learn  to  use  libraries  that  other \npeople had written just by inspecting their documentation. \nIn all that we did, we had full support from our faculty in charge as well as our mentor.. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : As  I've  said  before,  everything  that  we  were  able  to  do,  was  a \nmajor  learning  for  us.  Using  other  people's  open  source  libraries,  setting  up  project \nstructures the way they are set in a professional environment, a thorough understanding \nof blockchain as well  as a decent understanding of all the mathematical and computer \nscience related concepts involved in this field were all major learning outcomes.

Working   with   people   remotely,   maintaining   a   collaborative   and   friendly \nenvironment,   etc.   were   also   learning   outcomes   that   I   am   very   happy   to   have \nexperienced. \n \n \n------------"

Proper  analysis  and \nunderstanding of data allows individuals and companies to make meaningful decisions \nin  their  workflow.  When  an  organisation  hires  a  student  for  employment,  it  takes  into \n\n274 \n \nconsideration  the  various  curricular  and  non-curricular  activities  of  the  student,  so  that \nthe student with the perfect fit for the job profile is hired. \nOur responsibility was to build a data analytics tool, which would take a certain number \nof  parameters(the  parameters  being  the  academic  and  non-academic  activities  of  the \nstudent),  and  predicts  the  probability  of  him/her  getting  hired  by  a particular  firm.

We built  our  own  data  (it  was  not  given  to \n\n276 \n \nus) by having student data that have sat for placements and were recruited or not. Our \nprediction parameter was whether the student should be recruited or not. \nTo store the data, we used a MySql database, from where the data was called using a \nPython  script  and  then  loaded  into  a  pandas  dataframe.  To  segregate  the  student  on \nparameters like CGPA, Work experience, etc, we had an interactive feature where the \nuser can  not  only  define  the  values  on  which  the  students  are  sorted,  but  also  can \nchoose the parameters itself on which the students are being sorted. Then the final data \nwas pushed back into the database for the rest of the tools to use.  \nThe cleaned data was used for building dashboards in Tableau to identify the relevant \nparameters. Each parameter was compared with the recruitment status to identify which \nparameter  actually  governs  whether  the  student  is  suitable  or  not.  These  charts  were \ndynamically changing whenever any parameter was changed. We also carried out PCA \nanalysis and a basic decision tree model in Tableau for the same.  \nWe  then  tried  5  classification  techniques  for  our  ML  model  and  identified  the  best \nperforming  one.  To  tackle  the  problem  of  which  student  has  priority  over  which  in  the \nrecruitment process, we built a regression model to assign a \"score\" (based on the most \ncorrelated  parameters)  to  generate  a  ranking  system.  Finally  using  TabPy  library,  we \nmanaged  to  run  our  Python  script  in  the  back-end,  and  link  it  into  an  interactive \ndashboard.  We  built  two,  one  where  the  dataset  can  be  used  and  the  other  where \nvalues could be manually entered to get a result. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was a wonderful experience for me. I and one other student in my \ngroup  had  taken  the  initiative  of  being  the  group  representative.  This  was  my  first \nproject  where  I  was  leading  the  group. The only  bad  thing  was  that  there  were  almost \nnext  to  no  interactions  from  Wipro's  side.  All  interactions  happened  through  our  PS \ninstructor. It was only because he was so energetic that all our queries were resolved. \nOur PS started almost a week late because there was no communication from Wipro's \nside.  Also,  our  industry  mentor  was  assigned  to  us  after  the  midterm  report  was \nsubmitted. Both mentors were incredibly helpful after being assigned to us and gave us \ngood  advice  regarding  our  project.  If Wipro was  as  invested  in  this  project  as us,  then \nthis would have been an ideal real-world industry project. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  was  never  that  interested  in  Data  analytics,  but  I  learnt  a  lot \nabout it. I learnt about taking timely decisions, and some soft skills. If Wipro would have \nguided us more, then maybe I would have learnt a lot more. We had to find most of the \nmaterials  and  work  around  every  detail  by  ourselves.  Had  these  been  resolved  by  our \nindustry mentor in time, then maybe the project, as well as our individual learning, would \nhave gone way further than expected. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n277"

These \ncomponents  process  the  videos  of  the  examinees,  captured  from  their  webcam.  The \nsuspicious frames are then saved as images for the examiner to review. The application \ncan evaluate subjective answers using NLP, while also checking for internal as well as \nexternal plagiarism. \n \n \n\n282 \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  a  good  experience. We  learnt  many  things  from  working  in  a \ncorporate  environment.  A  significant  part  of  the  internship  was  frequent  presentations, \ndiscussions  and  reports.  Apart  from  these,  learning  the  required  skills  in  a  short \nduration, understanding the mentor's expectations from the project and finding ways to \nrealise them were the major challenges. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  learnt  how  to  make  softwares  using  deep  learning  models.  I \nhave  also  developed  a  basic  understanding  of  how  large  softwares  work,  and  how \ndifferent   components   are   integrated   into   a   single   software.   Apart   from   these,   I \nvolunteered to be the representative of my team. Taking the responsibility helped me to \nwork  on  my  leadership  qualities  and  speaking  skills.  It  also  helped  me  develop \ninterpersonal skills. \n \n \n------------"
