This included a detailed study on stainless steel covering points like\ntypes of SS, types of corrosion in SS and criteria for selection of different grades of SS. After\nfinalizing the material for the valve, and having gained significant knowledge about the working\nof the valve, the next step was designing. For this, a benchmarking study was done based on\nASCO premium products followed by a study of competitor products. The takeaways from these\nstudies were used to develop numerous design proposals. Finally, by using a Pugh matrix, the\ndifferent   proposals   were   compared   and   ranked   based   on   different   factors   such   as   cost\neffectiveness, ease of assembly, manufacturability etc. and the best one was finalized for\nproduction.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): PTC Creo, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint.\nObjectives of the project: Design of 3/2 way solenoid valve for sea water application (direct\nacting and dry construction).\nMajor learning outcomes: Got to know about the process of product development in the core\nindustry. The journey starts from idea generation, concept definition and feasibility, concept\nverification followed by design and development and ultimately release of drawings and bill of\nmaterials for production.\nDetails of papers / patents: NA\nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company:   Due   to\npandemic, the entire PS2 was conducted in online mode. Since, the project was in the design\ndomain, there wasn‚Äôt any such difficulty due to online mode. Our main mentor was very helpful\nand supportive. Apart from him, we also had a 2nd mentor for our daily queries. We used to\nhave 2 meetings per week for discussing the plan for the week and progress so far. In every\nmeeting, we used to receive constructive feedback and they used to give some (not many)\ninputs to work upon. There was no ‚Äòspoon feeding‚Äô which was a great thing as it is necessary in\norder to facilitate the transition from college life to job life in a smooth manner which is the sole\n106\n\npurpose of Practice school program. The experience would have been better had we gotten a\nchance to visit the company which we couldn‚Äôt due to the pandemic. Overall, we learnt a lot\nfrom all the mentors and the company had a positive work environment.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Mechatronics and automation, Machine design\nand drawing, Fluid mechanics."

The company deals with alot of financial transactions with its clients, regarding\nthe same the invoices and all data is managed by the team. Main objective was to streamline\nthe data and produce visualizations so as to help them understand data better, rather than\nseeing the data in its raw form. The source data contains all department data (i.e. data with\nrespect to all departments of the company) but the data structure concerns only one of those\ndepartments. It is difficult to pick this data manually every time and also replace it with the main\nsource data. Excel sheets for the main data source are received at intervals , which may be\nupdated for certain values. There was a need to extract only the required data from this source\nsheet along with the other data (that is from a different source) parallely and update them into a\ndefined structure of data every time. So, a python script was created to do so. For that purpose,\nsome basic python related to / involving data analysis was required. Zoho analytics was used by\nthe company for storing and visualizing data. To create the data in the required format, SQL\nqueries were used and different tables were queried in order to create and extract data in\n238\n\nrequired form from all the tables data present on this platform. SQL functions knowledge could\nhave proved to be handy here.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Python, Zoho analytics, Data studio, MS excel.\nObjectives of the project: Data automation and data visualization.\nMajor learning outcomes: Importance of data analysis, Importance of data in judging client\ncompany relationship, Python.\nDetails of papers / patents: I didn't create any official product or something, just did data\nautomation and created dashboards on daily client data that the company stores.\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: As we all know\nthe working environment for this time were our own rooms at home due to pandemic, but yeah\nreally would have preferred to work by physically going to the company office, so as to get an\neveryday routine going. But yes, it is what it is so this time the working environment can be\nmeasured in terms of how our mentors handled as and to be honest in my case my mentor was\nvery positive and helpful, never pressured me for any task and helped me in cases where i\nneeded. I did learned a lot from her in dealing with corporate world. Also, the various employees\nto whom I was connected with any other work were very frank and helpful. You can expect a lot\nfrom the company in terms of learning but you have to work hard to learn things, you have to\npush yourself in terms of completing tasks\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Not exactly but mainly Python coding and MS\nexcel."

Then, queries are written using aggregate\npipeline in Mongo compass, and the desired code for the flask app is taken. The aggregation\npipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing\npipelines.   Documents   enter   a   multi-stage   pipeline   that   transforms   the   documents   into\naggregated results. Then, APIs are created in the flask framework using those previously written\nqueries and then tested in Postman. API testing is used to determine whether the output is well-\nstructured and useful to another application or not, checks the response on basis of input\n(request) parameter, and checks how much time the API is taking to retrieve and authorize the\ndata too. In this way, we finally get the working APIs which can directly be used in Angular using\nHTTP requests. Here, while working with the APIs, it's the choice of the developer either to write\nless APIs and take most of the desired data (this way will require more operations in the\nfrontend to filter the data) or to write a greater number of APIs and take specific data (in this\ncase, developer don‚Äôt need to make many efforts in frontend). Now, we use the APIs developed\nin backend using HTTP requests and perform several operations on data as per need.

Nuclear heat generated in the\nreactor core due to fission is extracted using liquid sodium as coolant. FBTR is loop type\nreactor, which has two primary loops to exchange the heat to secondary sodium system.\nFurther, heat in secondary sodium system is transferred to steam water system to generate\nelectricity. The heat generated inside the core is distributed equally to two primary loops. Each\nloop has a heat exchanger and sodium pump. After exchanging the heat to secondary sodium in\nthe heat exchangers in each loop sodium in both the loops is passed through a common inlet\npipe into the reactor vessel. Over flow tank collects the excess sodium in reactor vessel, and\nthrough EM pump part of the sodium is passed through a sodium purification circuit. Sodium\nreturn to reactor vessel after purification. Over flow tank plays important role in the maintenance\nof sodium level in RV. The decrease in sodium level in OFT is one of the indirect indications of\nleak in primary sodium loop. Hence, OFT sodium level discordance alarm is provided in main\ncontrol room to alert the operator, in case of change in the level of OFT. Presently, the alarm\nset-point is manually set by the operator in control station after OFT level stabilizes. However,\nOFT   also   changes   during   normal   process.   Since,   the   capacities   of   primary   loops   are\ninterconnected, with increase in sodium temperature, sodium volume also increases and hence\nthe level in various capacities and hence, it reflects an increase in sodium level in OFT. So, the\noperator has to frequently change or set the discordance alarm threshold during genuine\nprocess changes. Due to which it may happen that alarm due to actual leak may get masked\nduring process transients. Hence, it is required to have automatic set-point tracker to ensure\nthat set-point is automatically ‚Äútracked‚Äù following the OFT level in case of genuine process\nchanges. The project is to design and develop an automatic set-point tracker, which includes\nsignal conditioning of temperature signal, analyzing of data (sodium level vs temperature) and\nderiving relationship between the changes in OFT sodium level and changes in temperature and\nsuitably changing the set-point.\n280\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Python3, MATLAB.\nObjectives of the project: Automatic OFT level discordance setpoint tracker.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Got   experience   in   real   world   problems,   apply   knowledge   in\nindustrial process.\nDetails of papers / patents: Nil\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Work from\nhome environment.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: None"

All this was possible because my PS-2 was in a Fintech startup Jupiter, which\nis a leading Neobanking startup of India. Neobank is a virtual bank without any physical\nbranches but having all its facilities like savings account, FD, loans, credit card, etc. Jitendra\nGupta, Founder and CEO of Jupiter, was a seasoned entrepreneur in this domain (he had\nalready co-founded Citrus Pay now known PayU Money India). I was a part of the data science\nteam at Jupiter and had collaborated in various projects ranging from backend engineering, AI\nmodel engineering, DevOps to data analytics domain. During this journey, I got a hands-on\nexperience in using Python & Scala languages, Cloud services of AWS (EC2, S3, EKS,\nCloudWatch, Balancer, Elasticache, Athena, etc.) and cutting-edge technologies like Flair model\nfor NER, Redis for low latency database, Airflow scheduler (by Airbnb) for analytics jobs,\nSonarQube for code-quality checking, etc. Since, I got the opportunity to work in various groups\nin   data   science   team,   I   had   the   chance   to   interact   with   various   other   members   of   the\norganization and also our few mentors at Jupiter were BITSians.

They follow Agile\nframework with 14 days sprint planning and other long-term goals planning (like monthly or\nwithin 2-3 months). Here the hierarchy is Founder & CEO leading the firm along with leadership\nteams comprising of CXOs and VPs.

The larger domain of my\nwork was in hardware verification. I worked on a UVM testbench for USB verification, and more\nspecifically, I worked on the clocks and resets used by the USB controller. Shortly summarizing,\nmy main work involved adding features used by the clocks, such as clock randomization, to the\nUSB controller verification testbench. The work involved successfully simulating them in the\ntestbench using SystemVerilog and UVM, practically a library of classes that act as a verification\nmethodology. My resets' tasks involved sequencing the resets and simulating their sequence in\nthe testbench as it happens in real life during various scenarios, such as boot-up and during\ndata transfers. One of the other tasks, I had worked with SV Lint, a tool used to enforce coding\nguidelines and rules to nearly thousands of files that are part of the testbench.

As far as my work is\nconcerned, I did multiple projects, which majorly were in full-stack development and time-series\nforecasting using Machine learning. I also worked on quick automation-based projects as per\nthe requirement of the team. In the first project, my responsibility was to ideate and implement a\nfull-stack portal which was to be used for project tracking, storage of files and distribution to the\nclients under specified business constraints. I was given full freedom to plan the project and\ndecide on the tech-stack. I implemented the complete backend using Spring Boot (Java) and\nfrontend using Angular. Database chosen was MongoDB. In the other project, myself with my\nco-PS student were given the task to predict the future forecast of expenses for various\nbusiness   units   using   ML.   We   chose   SARIMAX   model   for   time-series   forecasting   and\nimplemented the complete business requirement logic around that using Python. We had to\ndynamically adjust as per business constraints and requirements. At the end, another ML based\nproject started but we were just helping hands in that due to time constraint. Apart from this, few\nautomation projects of manipulating excel, decoding encoded invoices, etc. was given for which\n578\n\nI was given the task to build automated workflows to get required output.

To ideate and\nimplement a time-series forecasting model to forecast monthly expenses in various business\nunits.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Time-series   forecasting,   full-stack   development,   end-to-end\ndevelopment project ideation and implementation, automation.\nDetails of papers / patents: None\nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company:   The\nenvironment at TR is great, and everyone is supportive.

I got a\nchance to interact and work with many cross-functional teams throughout my tenure, who\nworked at different places, like Bangalore, US, UK, under different domains, like accountancy,\nsales, technical, and people from upper management. The team is supportive of limitations and\npeople are willing to help. So, the exposure is great. The expectations that I experienced was\nthat I always had the option to specify my own deadlines, but it is expected of me to not exceed\nit. Working hours are friendly and there is always a flexibility to adjust it as per your need if one\ncan meet their commitment. However, one is expected to be available for all discussions and\nmeetings, whenever they are scheduled to be. But majority of the projects in the team are\nautomation based and so if someone wants to do different things (like development, ML), they\nhave to make efforts to get such a project in the bag and commit to deliver it. One is also\nexpected to self-learn and apply. Apart from automation, as the team is getting new into ML and\ndevelopment, there will not be much technical help around. All in all, I would summarize by\n579\n\nsaying that it is good option to have if someone is looking for just a good overall internship\nexperience only.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object oriented programming, Neural networks\nand Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Database systems."

The searching algorithms of social media App works\nbased on tags attached to the videos / content attached to it. Tags are keywords attached with\nthe videos that describes the type of the videos and content in the video. As Trell is a short\nvideo App like tik-tok, it is important for the contents to have proper tags associated with. Trell\nhas both paid and non-paid content creators. Sometimes, the content creators won‚Äôt be able to\nadd tags properly to their videos. Then, the organization has to do it. The organization also has\nto check whether the tags are attached correctly. Since, the volume of content uploaded\neveryday is huge, Trell gave this work to an external agency that tags these videos. The agency\ngoes through every trail inside the batch, attach the tags to it and then submit it back in batches.\nA batch contains around 50 to 100 trails. Around 30% of the trails in every batch is reviewed by\na moderator in Trell and see if the tags are given correctly according to the content of the trail. If\nthe moderator feels the tags are attached correctly then the batch is accepted, else they are\nrejected and is returned back for retagging. The web interface that is used by the agency and\ntaggers in Trell for tagging these trails is called content tagging dashboard. The quality checking\nof these tags by the moderators are done in another web interface. It is called quality control\ndashboard. I worked in the development of content tagging and quality control dashboards. I\nadded many other features and fixed several bugs inside both content tagging dashboard and\nqc dashboard.
