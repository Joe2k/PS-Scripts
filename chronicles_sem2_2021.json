This  project  is  a  part  of  Altair's  future \ndevelopment to understand user behavior by analyzing the command file.  \n\n75 \n \nAltair's old API has some problems while calculating the mass moment of inertia. So, apart from \nthe command analysis project, I got an opportunity to work on the real-time development of new \nmethod based on finite element approach to calculate mass moment of inertia. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): C++, Python, TCL, Hyperworks, Visual studio, VS \ncode, Qt designer, Perforce P4V, Jira, Compose. \n \nObjectives of the project: 1. A prototype project to analyze the command file by adding time \nstamping.  2.  Develop  a  new  C++  function  to  calculate  mass  moment  of  inertia  based  on  the \nfinite element method. \n \nMajor  learning outcomes: Object  Oriented  Programming,  Importance  of  code  structure, \nPrioritizing the things in complex work and gained sufficient knowledge on the tools mentioned \nabove. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Altair  treats \ninterns as an employee and allowed me to work on real-time issues apart from the project. I am \npart  of  the  hyperworks  core  development  team,  which  deals  with  command  API.  My  team \nmembers are very cooperative. They helped me whenever I was stuck at some point. The best \nthing  about  Altair  is  flexible  timings. They  believe  in  the  quality  of  work; that's  why  there  is  no \nworking  time  pressure  from  the  company.  Even  they  have  a  table  tennis  room  where  we  can \nrefresh  ourselves  when  we  feel  bored. We  can  also  ping  anybody  from  other  teams  for  doubt \nclarification. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Advanced  engineering  mathematics,  Finite \nelement method. \n \n \n \n\n76"

The mechanism needs to be robust so that it is applicable in multiple use cases \nwith  minimal  code  change.  We  intend  to  use  the  mechanism  to  alter  the  level  of  issuance  of \ncashback in potential abuse cases. This would be accomplished by using a deny listing solution \nwhich holds precedence over any other evaluation logic which could be used for determining the \nissuance level of cashback. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Git, Java, Intellij, Dynamo DB. \n \nObjectives of the project: To prevent failures in calwing back issued cashback. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understanding the order workflow, cancellation workflow and return \nworkflow. \nUnderstanding the services in the current architecture and their purposes in different workflows. \nPlanning Phase - Document for identifying abuse cases  \nDesign Phase - Design docs for high level design & low level design \nCoding Phase - Coding the API, UI and evaluators \nTesting Phase - Unit tests, Minimal beta deployment, QA testing \nReviewing Phase - Addressing comments, Answering queries \n \n\n93 \n \nDetails of papers/patents: Not Applicable \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Amazon gives \ncashback for certain products which are eligible under certain promotions. The cashback can be \ngratified either immediately after the order has been confirmed or after the shipment has been \ndispatched. A major issue with issuing cashback is when any cancellation occurs. An order can \nbe cancelled after the order has been placed until the order has been shipped. Once the order \ngets  shipped  it  cannot  be  cancelled  but  it  can  be  returned.  When  cashback  has  been  issued \nafter  the  order  is  confirmed  and then the  order gets  cancelled,  we  observe  abuse  cases  while \nclawing back issued cashback when the cancellation workflow goes through OMA or PCE. This \nproblem  can  be  side-stepped  by  having  a  mechanism  which  can  pre-determine  the  cashback \nfulfillment  issuance  level. We  need  to  build  such  a  mechanism  which  is  easy  to  use,  maintain \nand update. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Oops, DBMS, DSA."

The first was related to automation of alarms related to my team's \nservice.  The  existing  process  of  manually  creating  and  updating  alarms  is  not  scalable  and  is \ntedious  to  do  for  large  sets  of  alarms.  I  automated  this  using  Live  Pipeline  Templates,  a  tool \nused  to  programmatically  create  pipeline,  Apollo  stages,  alarms  and  dashboards.  For  my \nsecond  project,  I  had  to  accommodate  a  list  of  holidays  within  the  exception  dates  attribute \nwithin  customer  delivery  profile.  The  previous  functionality  allowed  customers  to  opt  out  of \ndelivery  on  federal  holidays  each  of  which  could  be  associated  with  only  one  date.  I  extended \nthis to include a list of holidays, such as in Diwali or Eid. For my final project, I had to include a \nlocker accessibility option as an additional address attribute. In certain specific locations in the \nUS, lockers had been introduced so that packages could be safely delivered when a customer \nwas not at home. I had to include an option for the customer to opt for delivery to a lower locker \n\n129 \n \nslot. This feature will be helpful for differently abled people to collect their parcels.

After a basic design approach was set, I started writing code, one API at a time, building it \nend to end along with the integration test files. The main code was contained in AWS Lambda \n\n135 \n \nfunctions(which  activate  and  run  the  code  based  on  a  trigger)  and  I  spent  most  of  my  time \nwriting  them  using  relevant  Java  software  development kits.  The  testing  was  mostly  on  AWS \nAPI  Gateway  to  verify  the  output for the  different  operations. I  used  AWS  CDK  to  build  all  the \ncloud  infrastructure  needed  for  my  service.  This  was  really  useful  as  now  the  service \ninfrastructure could easily be replicated to different AWS accounts and even be rendered out as \na template to allow easy building of infrastructure. Towards the end, I spent most of my time on \ncode  reviews.  Once  the  code  reviews  were  done,  the  project  was  completed  and  pushed  to \nproduction.  Finally,  I  needed  to  create  good  documentation  for  future  reference.  This  was \nparticularly important as the system will be modified in the future as and when the need arises, \nand a good documentation goes a long way in code maintainability. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): AWS technologies like Lambda, CDK, AppConfig, \nS3, DynamoDB, SNS, CloudFormation. \nProgramming Languages - Java, JavaScript, TypeScript. \nInternal Amazon development tools. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: My  team  at  Amazon  had  been  using  a  legacy  configuration \nmanagement system for some time. Now, that system was being deprecated and needed to be \nreplaced with a new system. My project was to build a new Configuration Management System \nfor  my  team.  The  idea  was  to  use  native  AWS  technology,  which  would  be  supported  for  a \nlonger  duration  of  time  such  that  the  system  has  a  long  lifetime.  The  project's  scope  included \nwork  estimation,  coding,  testing,  and  code  deployment.  The  aim  was  to  give  a  build  a  fully \nfunctional configuration management service within the duration of the internship. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: My  journey from  campus  to  corporate  was  amazing.  I  learnt  a  lot \nabout Amazon and my team's work. More importantly, I learnt the soft skills needed to work in a \ncorporate  environment.   Regular   meetings,   one-on-ones,   and  stand-ups   with  my   mentor, \nmanager, and other team members were enriching and helped me be a better professional. As \nan add-on, I got the opportunity to learn many new and modern technologies, which will help me \nin  my  future  projects.  I  learnt  a  lot  of  AWS  technologies.  These  technologies  are  used  by \nworldwide  customers.  Hence,  this  experience  will  be  useful  for  me  in  any  of  AWS  consumer \ncompanies as well. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n\n136 \n \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Amazon  is  a \ngreat place to work if you are looking for exciting work and writing code that will directly impact \ncustomers.  There  will  be  a  lot  of  learning  opportunities.  A  mentor  will  be  assigned  to  you  for \nproject related queries. Although, work can get a little hectic at times, the overall experience for \nme was amazing. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Data  Structures  and  Algorithms, Data  Bases, \nObject Oriented Programming, Software Engineering."

Due  to  various  updates,  these  applications \nare now to be used for an even wider user base, thus requiring a large increase in the scale of \nthe deployments. This scaling if done on the on-premise servers, will lead to inefficiencies in the \nresource utilisation thus leading to extra cost incurred. It would also be highly time consuming to \nhost  them  on  the  bare  metal  servers  where  all  of  the  updation  and  management  is  done \nmanually. Thus, there is a need to shift to a system, which can allow us to scale the applications \nwithout  any  need  of  manual  intervention.  We  also  want  a  system,  where we  can  update  our \napplications  seamlessly  and  in  as  less  time  as  possible.

Diabetes  results  in  rise  in  blood  glucose \nlevels  caused  by  defects  in  insulin  action,  secretion,  or  both.  This  rise  in  blood  glucose  levels \nresults in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are major cause for \nthe   development   of   diabetic   complications   like   diabetic   retinopathy,   neuropathy   and \ncardiomyopathy. There are speculations about diabetes being a generational disease based on \nsome pedigree  studies,  meaning  that  diabetes  in  parents  can  have  effects  on  successive \ngeneration individuals. But till date, there are no detailed studies which covers this aspect. Thus, \nthrough  this  study,  we  address  if  high  glucose  stress  given  to  parental  generation  can  have \neffects  on  subsequent  two  generations  in  terms  of their  AGEs  levels.  In  addition  to  this,  I  was \n\n215 \n \nalso  checking  if  an  antiglycation  agent,  carnosine  can  combat  the  effects  caused  by  high \nglucose  stress  in  subsequent  generations.  Candida elegans  was  used  as  the  model  organism \nfor all the studies. As the hyperglycemic state observed in diabetic patients can be mimicked in \nC. elegans, it is considered as one of the ideal models for diabetes related studies. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): OriginPro 9.0, Fluorescence spectroscopy, FT-IR, \nELISA. \n \nObjectives of the project: To evaluate the effect of high glucose stress on AGEs levels in C. \nelegans.

			"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Cisco  provides  multiple  solutions  in  order  to \nmanage  Firepower  Threat  Devices  (FTDs).  These  solutions  vary  in  terms  of scalability  and \noffering  of  various  features.  Firepower  Device  Manager  (FDM)  is  a  single-device  on-box \nmanagement  solution  that  manages  FTDs.  Firepower  Management  Centre  (FMC)  is  the \nadministrative  nerve  centre  for  managing  critical  Cisco  network  security solutions.  It  provides \ncomplete and unified management over firewalls, application control, intrusion prevention, URL \nfiltering, and advanced malware protection. Team can view details about customer video mesh \ndeployments.  Typically,  medium  and  large-scale customers  exceed  the  limit  of  number  of \ndevices managed by a single FMC or FDM instance. Hence, there is a need to migrate policies \nfrom one FMC to another or from one FDM to FMC. As part of this project, the idea is to develop \na robust framework that is capable of inputting different configuration data sources to FMC and \nachieve a data driven model converter. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Golang, Visual Studio Code, Github, Postman. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  project  consists  of  3  different  use  cases,  out  of  which  I  am \ninvolved with the 3rd use case, that is, Data Migration from FDM to FMC of the Data Migration \nService Development. The problem statement of the project is as follows: FDM and FMC both \nare  managers  for  FTD.  FDM  is  installed by  default  on  the  device  and  it  can  manage  just  that \ndevice.  FMC  can  manage  up  to  800 FTDs.  Every  time  a  customer  buys  an  FTD,  he  needs  to \n\n228 \n \nconfigure  an  FDM  to  manage  that  device.  Also,  the  FDM  provides  limited  features  while  the \nFMC  provides  multiple  features.  So,  the  same  FTD  is  managed  by  multiple  managers.  If  an \nFMC is provisioned for the customer, he will be liberated from managing multiple FDMs. All the \nFTDs  can  be  configured  and  managed  by  one  FMC  until  it  reaches  its  full  capacity,  when \nanother FMC  will be provisioned for the customer. So, the objective is to migrate configuration \nfrom Single-Device on-box manager (FDM) to Multi-Device Manager (FMC). \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understanding the architecture and working of FMC and FDM, the \nvarious object configurations, software designing in industry, practical exposure to REST APIs, \nGo programming language, working with visual studio code, Git, REST APIs using Postman. \n \nDetails  of  papers/patents: A  survey  on  the  role  of  Internet  of  Things  for  adopting and \npromoting.

I  got  to  understand  how  operational  risk  management  plays  a  major \nrole  in  a  financial  institution  and  the  parameters  upon  which  risks  are  weighted  and the \nremediations or the controls that are in place to deal with these risks. Being a part of the team \nthat created SOP gave me an edge to understand fine tuning and presentation details. \n \n\n250 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Microsoft Office, Credit Suisse reporting tools. \n \nObjectives  of the  project: Consolidation  of  operational  risk  incidents  occurring  at global  level \nacross   all   divisions   and   reporting   them   to   Board   of   Directors   and   Risk   Management \nCommittees.   Analysis   of   Incident   metrics   for   Annual Operational   Risk   Appetite   setting. \nAutomation of key datasets used for identification of risk themes. Creating quality control file to \nhelp validate data creation of SOP for the reports. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Broader understanding of the risk concepts. The need for risk and \ncontrol framework to manage operational risks, how we define risk appetite, what are the types \nof risk and how they’re classified and also the various jargons used in the industry.I learnt the \nstandard ways of reporting and fine tuning to precision. I’m also constantly exposed to materials \nthat  are  consumed  by  the  top  management  in  the  company  and  I  work  most  of  the  time  with \nthese  reports.I  took  up  an  initiative  recently  where  I  set  up  knowledge  sharing  sessions  with \nSubject  Matter  Experts  from  different  teams  to  understand  their  nature  of  work  and  how  the \nteam operates. This has helped us all learn about functioning of different teams and their roles \ninturn understanding how they contribute to the department.  \nI’ve also taken responsibility and accountability  with tasks and made sure the key deliverables \nwere completed on time. I’ve been proactive and also reach out to my managers to ensure \naccuracy and timeliness to meet their expectations.This has helped me communicate effectively \nthroughout  and  be  able  to  convey  my  issues  and  concerns. My  recent  training  session also \nhelped me learn advanced excel and VBA skills which would help me contribute efficiently to my \nwork. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: None \n \nBrief description  of  working environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  reports \nand  the  projects  worked  upon  are  sent  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  weekly,  monthly  and \nquarterly basis. The appetite setting is done on a yearly basis where this tolerance limit is used \nby  all  the  divisions  and  legal  entities  around  the  globe.  This  is  the  maximum  loss  that  can  be \ntaken by the organisation and hence these tolerance limits are set using metrics calculations for \nacross  the  globe.  The  analytics  and  projections  helps  to  understand  the  changes/  losses  that \ncould be expected in the coming cycles and methods to avoid them are suggested. \n \n\n251 \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Financial Management and Accounting, Marketing \nResearch, Corporate Finance and Taxation."

			"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary   of   work   done   during   PS-II: The   internship   at   Dell   Technologies, \nBangalore(Dell EMC) is quite structured. First few weeks involved general ramp up under hiring \nmanager. After this interns in our batch were allocated to specific teams where the next one-two \nweeks  involved  team  specific  ramp  up  which  also  involved  KT  sessions.  In  my  case  I  got  to \nwork with NetWorker product of EMC to take backup, perform restore etc. The KT sessions on \nNetWorker were helpful to get a brief understanding of NetWorker's operation. Dell handed over \nNetWorker development to HCL as part of transition. For the next project, I was part of SDNG \nteam  and  worked  with  DDSD  API. I  worked with senior  engineer  on  logging  functionality  for \n\n285 \n \nDDSD API and came up with macros/inline functions to replace conditional ENTRY/EXIT traces \nfor  logging.  To  successfully  complete  this  task  also  required  separating  the  APIs  according  to \ntheir functionality(backup/restore) and understanding the C code base for these APIs and relate \nwith  the  flow.  After  this, I  worked  on  two  Power  Protect  Data  Manager  bugs  for  DDSD  API. \nThese  bugs  were  associated  with  DDSD  API's  integration  with  PowerStore  storage  array.  I \ngained significant exposure to debugging and code flow while working on these bugs. I was able \nto close off one bug. Second one was a bit complex bug which I handed over to senior engineer \nafter my analysis. Lastly, I was alloted a JIRA story to add code for plugging a memory leak in \none of the APIs. I closed off the story successfully by adding the code, testing it and getting it \nreviewed from senior devs. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, VIM Editor, Perforce \nP4V client, VMware vSphere web client, Beyond Compare, Bugzilla, JIRA, Review Board Tool, \nWinSCP. \n \nObjectives of the project: Feature Implementation for DDSD API. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I  was  exposed  to  industry-level  production  codes  for  the  first  time \nand able to contribute on a live project was truly a great experience for me. The transition from \ncollege to corporate was made easier due to this PS2 program. Along the way, I was exposed \nto many new tools/softwares that are used in a software development. Also just due to this PS2 \nprogram and project requirement here, I was able to learn JAVA. I was offered a PPO after the \nend of my internship as well. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: Nil \n \nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company: The \nenvironment at Dell Technologies(EMC) is very supportive. You can approach anyone right from \nthe engineer level to senior manager level at any time and they will always be available to guide \nyou. Moreover, the internship is very structured and they will take care of everything right from \nramp-ups to project allocation. The projects allocated arerelated to data protection. Even though \nthe internship was in a WFH mode, the timings are very flexible for interns. They just expect you \nto  complete  the assignments  on  time.

			"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary of work done during PS-II: Development - A new product feature was added \nto give support for GCP services. Account creation/updation/deletion services have been added. \nListing resources of the GCP account and allowing for on-demand snapshots was done. Audit of \naccount  related  activities  was  also  added to  show  what  tasks  were  done  and  their  respective \nstatus (completed/error/in-progress etc). \nDesign - As  AWS  and  Azure  platforms  are  already  supported,  help  was  taken  from  these \nservices, control  and  data  flow,  UI  design,  front  end user  input  checks  and generating  correct \napi-uri parameters were done. \nTesting - The newly generated UI for GCP and dashboard have been tested for various screen \nsizes,   browsers   (Chrome,   Mozilla   and   IE).   Validations   for   user   input   on   account \ncreation/updating  have  been  done.  Responses  from  various  api  calls  to  the  server  have  been \ntested to ensure correct information is displayed on UI. \nImprovement  in  productivity and  efficiency - As  new  preact  Javascript  library  have  been  used \nreplacing the older angular code, many api calls are reduced. Earlier many HTML, JS, CSS files \nwere  requested  from  server  for  a  single  view  but  Preact  has  reduced  the  number  of  these \nrequests  to  1  for  each.  This  reduced  the  load  time,  memory  usage  and  network  bandwidth \nrequirement to a minimum.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): IDE - VScode \nLanguage - TypeScript \nBrowser - Chrome, Mozilla, IE \n \n\n289 \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Adding  Google  Cloud  Platform  (GCP)  support  for  Cloud  Snapshot \nManager  and  refactoring  the  dashboard to  use  new  Preact  based  components  replacing  older \nversion in angular. \nMajor learning outcomes: Worked on code -  \n1.  Production  ready  code  is  highly  modular  in  design  and  structure.  This  is  required  for  good \nreadability  and  modifiability  of  code  in  future.  Team  members  working  on  the  same  code  can \neasily understand the purpose and internal functioning of snippets.  \n2. For UI,  the HTML elements are wrapped inside custom components which makes it easy for \nre-use and modification to suit the context.  \n3.  The  JS  version  used  (typescript) is  open-source  making  it easy  to  use.  There  is  a  strict \nimposition of data structure on the objects used thus ensuring that only correct data formats are \nused. \n4. The application brings under its control almost all possible use cases to make sure none of \nthe conditions are unhandled when application is in use by the customer. \n5.  Comments  are  extremely  important  to  help  understand  input/expected  output  of  code \nsnippets. Applications usually  live for 10-12 years which requires proper transfer of knowledge \nfrom current to future team members.  \n6.  Coding  conventions  developed  should  be  strictly  followed.  This  make  it  easy  for  other \nmembers to understand the semantics of variable names and function prototypes. Terminology \nrelated to product is easily understood making development faster and testing easier. \nWorked as a team member - \n1.  Ask  for  help  and  be  ready  to  help  any  time.  Mistakes  are  unavoidable  but  learning  and \nimprovement are most important. \n2. Time management is very important. Delaying work can cause problems as time might not be \navailable later. \n3. Conceptual understand of project is required before we start coding.  \n4. Keeping the data safe is very important. Many times machines failed during the development \nand data was lost. Commiting any work done to remote repository is important. \n5. Taking breaks from work can lead to relaxed mind and increases productivity. This also helps \nto come up with solutions to problems. \n6.  Look  for  solutions  on  internet.  Ask  team  members  and  proceed.  Also  remember,  they  are \nalso busy. Respect each ones time and work. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n\n290 \n \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Organization of \nTeam - Two distinct groups of people for - Front End, Back End. \nInitially, a small assignment was given to bring familiarity with the tools used for the project. This \nhelped me to understand what is expected of the project on a bigger scale.Teams were highly \nengaged with each other as in scrum process. Free flow of ideas among all members including \nthe   higher  management   concerned  with  the  project.  Weekly   meetings   ensured   work   is \nprogressing in desired direction with good amount of work done. Challenges when encountered \nwere resolved with help from members. Some were simple but some took around a weeks time \nto  get  resolved.  Manager  understood  the  challenges  as  we  are  working  from  home  and  its \ndifficult  to  get  other  person  immediately  online.  Sufficient  time  was  given  to  understand  the \nproject.  They  were  considerate  enough  to  change the  schedule  for  demo  of  project  when  I \nrequired some  other  urgent  work.The  technical  lead  was  very  helpful  and  open  for  any  doubt \nsession. Sometimes he even showed me the line number and function name that needs to be \ncalled. At other times, he would give me time to study the code and understand the concept and \ntools used on my own.   \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Research Practice - extremely helpful. \nNetworking - making api calls to remote hosts."

After  getting  a  basic  understanding  of  pricing  algorithms,  I  chose  a \nbusiness  case  to  work  on  i.e.  'Consumers  end  up  paying  more  due  to  high-frequency  pricing \nalgorithms.'  So,  the  goal  that  I  tried  to  achieve  here  was  to  develop  a  pricing  tool  for  the \nretailer/target  firm  to  monitor  weekly  prices  and  volume  for  everyday  grocery  items.  Through \nthis, they can select the algorithm that gives the 'maximum revenue' for their particular business \nstrategy, while also keeping 'consumer's interest' at hand. \nI chose 2 food items – ‘yogurt’ and ‘salsa’ and 1 beverage – ‘beer’ as our products for which we \nmade  weekly  price  recommendations,  estimated  the  weekly  demand,  and  calculated  the \ncorresponding  revenue  generated.The  algorithms  that  were  used  in  the  simulating  product \nprices were 'Thompson Sampling', 'Q-Learning' (Reinforcement learning techniques), and 'Joint \ndistribution-KDE' in python.Finally, I made a pricing tool on 'Power BI' for the retailer/target firm \nwhich helps them monitor Actual v/s Predicted (prices, volume, and revenue). \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Microsoft  Excel,  Python,  Jupyter-lab,  Spyder, \nMachine learning, Reinforcement learning, Power BI. \n \nObjectives of the project: Provide some improved gross revenue margin to the retailer/target \nfirm  on  everyday  grocery  items  like  yogurt,  salsa,  and  beer  through  the  use  of  pricing \nalgorithms, while creating a good consumer experience. \n \n\n323 \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Experience of working in a professional environment. \nImportance of effective communication, teamwork and efficient planning. \nApplication of technical concepts to live problems. \nI learnt how to own the task and work independently. \nHow meetings happen and deadlines are set. \nI got a chance to improve my interpersonal skills. \nI learnt Microsoft Excel, Python and ML,RL for data analysis and model building. \nI learnt Power BI for building reports, dashboards & interactive tools for data visualization. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: A White-Paper on 'Algorithmic Pricing in Retail Industry'. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Mostly,  the \nwork  was  focused  on  New  Product Development - creating  a  dynamic  pricing  tool  that \ncompared  certain  algorithms  and  implements  the  best  one  in  that  business  case  scenario.For \nthe  initial  stages,  some  amount  of  research  is  required  to  understand  the  existing  literature \naround the project and thus, develop a unique solution solving the chosen business case. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: It  is  good  to  have  knowledge  of  Principles  of \nEconomics, Supply Chain Management, Machine Learning.

And  the \nother two projects were based on product sales forecast with various time series models using \nMS Excel and R programming. \nFor the first project, I identified a specific product category which was nutraceuticals. I selected \ndifferent brands of Biotin tablets and then I did the web scraping. So with web scrapping, I was \nable  to  gather   important   data  like  product   name,  ratings,   title  and  review.   I   used  the \nBeautifulSoup  library  of  python  to  carry  out  this  task  and  finally  exported  that  as CSV  file  and \ngot 500+ reviews for sentiment analysis. And then for the next step, I removed the punctuations, \nand  stop  words  and  cleaned  the data.  I  carried  out  text  pre-processing  and  for  that,  Natural \nLanguage  Toolkit  (or  NLTK),  a  platform  for  building  Python  programs  to  work  with  human \nlanguage  data,  was  used.

When  these  get  applied  on  the  device  and  the \nsettings, there can be conflicts and we can never predict the state of the settings on the device. \nWe thus  propose  a  similarity check  system  and  associated  methods  to  automatically  co-relate \nattributes exposed in multiple management systems using machine learning and text analytics. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Worked  on  several  python  tools  and  libraries.  Learnt natural \nlanguage processing. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: None \n \n\n352 \n \nBrief  description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: There  will  be \nregular meetings to discuss the progress. The project work is self paced with no strict deadlines. \nThe mentors and managers are extremely helpful.

A  good  mix  of  exposure  towards  capital \nmarkets, fixed income markets, derivatives modelling, capital structure, liquidity analysis, ad-hoc \nresearch work. As an intern you'll be involved in helping the team making pages based on the \nresearch  that  you/your  team  undertakes.  I  also  get  to  work  with  the  onshore  bankers  directly \nand  present  new  ideas  for  certain  concepts  but  being  the  giant  J.P.

On  the  SPAC  side, learnt about  this  new  product  which  was  in  spotlight  during  the \npandemic. Learnt about the mathematical stress testing on the important metrics for a company \nand how J.P. Morgan bankers look at the balance sheet of a company (primarily debt). \n \nDetails of papers/patents: None \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: It  was  WFH \nbut still one would get the heat of Investment Banking. The company expects you to deliver high \nlevel and correct output for everything. Things like PPT hygiene and backup hygiene is a basic \nexpectation. Since, the teams are aligned with geographies like Asia, EMEA, NA, following the \ntimelines correctly for the projects become an important part. Although, they do not expect you \nto  present  new  ideas  around  any  topic  but  if  you  are  abreast  with  the  financial  news  and  can \nfind something related to your project, the bankers and heads do appreciate that. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: DRM, FM, BAV, SAPM, FoFA (My alignment with \n3 teams got all these courses covered)."

			"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Inside  Nutanix,  the  PC-PE  un-registration \nworkflow  was  causing  a  lot  of  bugs  and  uncertainty.  The  registration  workflow  was  also  in  a \nsimilar  state  earlier  but  was  refactored  recently,  the  same  was  done  for  un-registration  in  this \nproject.  \n\n535 \n \n1) A task-based framework has been added over the un-registration workflow - We create one \nparent task which tracks the progress of several child tasks .Currently in the un-registration flow, \nthere  are  several  small  sub  processes,  we  make  a  child  task  for  each  of  these  sub-\nprocesses.As  the  child  tasks get  completed,  we  move  forward  the  progress  of  parent Task.  In \ncase any of the child task fails, the parent task automatically fails. Only if all the child tasks get \nsuccessfully completed, we mark the parent task as completed. \n2) Cleanup, which was earlier performed using a Python script, now has been added as a part \nof  un-registration  workflow - For  migrating  these  clean-up  scripts,  I  had  to  understand  how  to \nconstruct  complex  IDF  queries  inside  the  prism  gateway  codebase. In  order  to  successfully \nimplement  these  I  coordinated  with  the  IDF  team  and  got  their  review  as  well  after  successful \nimplementation. \n3)  An  annotation  based  method  of  declaring  pre-checks  and  cleanups - This  solution  involves \ncreating two custom annotations, one for pre-check and one for clean-up. Any team can declare \ntheir pre-check and clean-up functions in their own class with these annotations. The annotation \nprocessor will automatically add these to the un-registration workflow. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Maven - Apache Maven is a software project and \ndependency management tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven \ncan  manage  a  project's  build,  the  version  of  dependencies  to  be  used  and  several  other \nproperties in a central manner.  \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  refactor  the  un-registration \nworkflow  and  get rid  of the flaws  associated  with  it.  Some  of refactoring changes: 1.  Adding a \ntask based framework 2. Adding Zookeeper check to avoid race condition 3. Writing a custom \nannotation processor and generator. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I learnt how  to  use  Nutanix  tools  and  libraries  to  quickly  and \nefficiently   create,  manage  new   packages   and   services.Creating   detailed   and  descriptive \ndocumentation was another key learning I had. The design docs helped me to understand how \nto  analyse  a  problem  and  its  requirements,  come  up  with  multiple  solutions,  identify  their \nassumptions,  pros  and  cons,  etc.Some  of  the  frameworks  and  libraries  I  learnt  as  part  of  this \nproject are spring boot, Rest, JUnit, Java Poet, etc. I also learnt how to  write proper unit tests \nthat  cover  all  possibilities  and  scenarios.I  learnt  the  importance  of  proper  logging  through  this \ninternship. All the bug tickets that were assigned to me in this internship had the log files. Ability \n\n536 \n \nto  read  and  search  the  logs  in  an  efficient  manner  was  one  of  my  key  learnings.  This  also \nhelped me realize what all things I should log in my own code for good readability of my logs in \nfuture.Code  reviews  helped  me  a  lot  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  code  I  write  and  familiarize \nmyself  with  the  various  tech  practices  present  in  the  industry.  The  review  also  helped  me  to \nunderstand how to find bugs and resolve them. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment  at  Nutanix  is  extremely  positive.  All  the  team  members  were  available  to  me  and \nwere  very  helpful  at  every  stage.  They  provided  constant  support,  motivation  and  guidance \nthroughout my internship.This internship was great opportunity for me to interact with people in \ndifferent roles at Nutanix.It made me aware about the latest technologies used in the industry.It \nwas a great place to experiment, learnt from the mistakes and find my interest field. It was also \nwonderful  chance  to improve  my  communication  and  presentation  skills.

The \nprimary  focus  of  our  work  was  to  develop novel  approach  to  handle  virtual  machine  live \nmigrations. One of the major problems in VM live migration is memory dirtying. Dirtying refers to \nthe modification of any memory page owned by the VM. Frequently dirtied memory needs to be \ntransferred  repeatedly  over  the  entire  duration  of  migration.  As  a  result,  when  the  memory \ndirtying  rate  is  high  and  network  bandwidth  is  limited,  migration  may  not  converge.  Throttling \nVMs to reduce vCPU execution time is the current approach in QEMU to handle such cases of \n\n537 \n \nhigh memory dirtying. Existing throttling algorithms throttle all the vCPUs of a VM, penalise read \nand  write  processes  across  all  vCPUs  equally.  We developed new  dirty  quota  based throttling \nalgorithm  that  selectively  throttles  vCPUs  based  on  their  individual  contribution  to  overall \nmemory  dirtying  and  also  dynamically  adapts  the  throttle  based  on  the  available  network \nbandwidth. Our approach drastically reduced migration times and also enabled the convergence \nof migrations in P99 and P99.9 cases which was not possible before. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): C, Vim, Git, Crash, kprobe. \n \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Devise  a  vCPU,  aware  VM  live  migration  algorithm  that  enables \nfaster convergence of live migrations. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Strengthened  my  OS  and  memory  management  concepts,  learnt \nvirtualisation  from  scratch, good  understanding  of  KVM  and  QEMU  codebases,  gained  Linux \nkernel development and debugging experience.  \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: I  found  the \nworking environment at the company was very good.

The topic for reset design is surprisingly very complex but unfortunately it is \npoorly emphasized. Generally, Engineering schools do not adequately allude to detailing pitfalls \nof  improper  reset  design.  Improper  reset  design  may  lead  to  the  problem  ofmetastability  as  a \nresult of which short circuit path may be formed between Vddand ground which  is undesirable \nas it can lead to huge short circuit powerdissipation.

			"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: One  major  part  of the  work  I  had  undertaken  at \nUber involved  writing SQL queries to retrieve information from the Uber databases, which  was \nthen imported into and processed within dashboards created mainly through the use of Google \nsheets. Oftentimes,  I was also tasked with creating these Google dashboards to track a host of \nmetrics (such as total trips taken, trips per rider, gross bookings, number of promotion trip taken, \netc.)  for  new  market  regions  or  new  payment  partners.  I  also  had  the  chance  to  assist  with \nnumerous  ad-hoc  analyses  and  one-time  data  pulls  which  basically  required  me  to  query  out \nsome  data  from  the  database,  import  it  into  Google  sheets  and  then  use  sheets  formulae  to \ncondense that raw data into useful/readable metrics which were then organised and presented \nin  a  final  view.  Another  type  of  work  that  I  was  tasked  with  was  doing  BAU  (or  Business  as \nUsual) tasks, the most common of which involved updating existing dashboards with the latest \nweekly and monthly data at the start of a new week or month. In most cases, when a new query \nneeded  to  be  written,  I was  usually  provided  with  an  existing  query  that  retrieved  similar  data, \nand would just edit that query as per my own needs and requirements. As such, writing queries \nfrom absolute scratch was quite uncommon. \n \n\n736 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): There was a wide range of tools that I used over \nthe  course  of  my  work  at  Uber,  however  most  of  those  tools  were  internal  tools,  exclusive  to \nUber such as Querybuilder, so I had to learn how to use them from the ground. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: As  there  was  no  single  \"project\"  that  I  was  assigned,  most  of the \nwork I did involved assisting more senior analysts with their work, or completing tasks that I was \ndirectly assigned by managers/team leads. So, some of the \"objectives\" of the numerous tasks \nand  projects  I  worked  on  included:  setting  up  new  dashboards;  performing  post-promotional \ncampaign data analyses to quantify how well a promotion performed; cleaning up and updating \nan onboarding document that is shared with all new Uber joinees; and automating queries used \nby large projects to eliminate the need to manually run them, amongst other things. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: The major learning outcomes I gained were:  \n- Writing and optimisation of SQL queries. \n-Creation, updation and maintenance of Dashboards on Google Sheets \n- Usage of Google sheets formulae to process raw data into readable/useful metrics. \n- Automation of queries through the use of the internal uWorc tool. \n- Creation of custom database tables with the Kirby internal tool. \n-Cross-team communication when working on large multi-team projects. \n- Time-management/organisational skills, required to keep up the flow of continuous tasks and \nprojects. \n- Ability to quickly identify and find necessary database tables through the Databook internal tool \n- Communication  skills,  required  when  presenting  the results  of  your  work  to  the  associated \nstakeholders. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment at Uber is a very dynamic and fast-paced one where you will recieve new work and \ntasks on daily basis. Despite this, your team members and other analysts are very friendly and \nsupportive and will be happy to help you out. Due to the organisations emphasis on \"ownership\" \nof work, you will not only have to finish the work/tasks assigned to you, but will also be expected \nto maintain and update any and all dashboards, documents and queries you create during your \ntime  at  Uber.  Also,  even  though  you  will  have  a  mentor  and  be  part  of  a  larger  team,  most \n\n737 \n \nanalysts work on their tasks alone, and usually only reach out to others for help/assistance. The \nsame  is  true  of  interns  and  you  will  most  likely  be  the  only  one  working  on  a  specific \ntask/project.  In  terms  of  work  deadlines,  they  aren't  very  strict,  and  you'll  usually  just  have  to \nfinish  your  work  as  soon  as  possible,  or  within  the  stipulated  time  that  your  stakeholder \nmentions. You will also have a lot of freedom to meet and interact with people from other teams, \nas oftentimes, the most well-qualified person to resolve your doubts may not be from your own \nteam. Furthermore, since everyone in the organisation uses either Google Hangouts or Slack, it \nisn't difficult to communicate with others, despite the limitations of WFH. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Unfortunately,   due   to   my   background   in \nMechanical  Engineering,  none  of  the  academic  courses  I  had  completed  were  relevant  to  the \nwork and projects I contributed to at Uber."
