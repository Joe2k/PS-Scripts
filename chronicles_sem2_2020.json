A model \nwas  developed  for movement to  and from  DELHI,  KOLKATA  and  MUMBAI,  by  using  inter-city \nand  sub-urban  trains. A  cost  model  was  developed  for  Mumbai sub-urban  train  movement,  of \nwhich,  a  pilot  run  was  done  by  me  in  February  and  March,  2020.  Efficiency  of  this  movement \nwas increased by bringing about change in the original plan and with the help of Indian railways. \nI  learned  about  Amazon  and  Indian  railways  network  and  how  these  can  be  intertwined  for \nbenefit of both. I also learned about cost modeling and the challenges faced while implementing \na cost model in real life and how to overcome them. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MS EXCEL, SQL, AMAZON FMC. \n \nObjectives of the project: 1.

I joined on 27th Jan, 2020. I worked in non-tech profile as \noperation manager intern in logistics network. We underwent a 10 day training at warehouses, \nsort centers  and delivery centers  of  Amazon  to  better understand  the  network.  After  which  we \nwere allotted our project. People at amazon are very helpful if you are interested to learn. The \nbest part is that they will only show us a way of solving a problem and will not spoon feed us. \nWe have to try out things, make mistakes and learn. Also, amazon has an excellent work culture \nas  the  people  are  very  welcoming,  treating  the  interns  as  a  part  of  the  team  like  any  other \nemployee  rather than  as  outsiders.  All  in  all,  Amazon  makes  a great  work  place  and  is  a  very \ngood place to learn for people who aspire to create their future in operations. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, PRODUCTION \nPLANNING AND CONTROL, OPTIMIZATION."

On  analyzing  the  current  condition,  I  have  challenged  with five  obstacles  for \nenabling  palletization.  1.  Larger  variation  of  MR  vehicle  height  corresponding  to  OB  dock  (+/- \n30cms) 2. No frugal dock leveler solution for loading pallets to MR vehicles 3. Adverse impact in \nMR  vehicle  utilization  due  to  current  pallet size  (1.2m  X  1.0m)  4.  Negative  cost  impact  due  to \nthe demand for dedicated vehicle requirements for pallet recirculation between SC – LM 5. Non-\navailability of ZBS layout for palletizing MR lanes.

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: During  my  PS2  at  Amazon  as  an  operations \nmanager,  I  did  two  major  projects.  First  was  to redesign  the  delivery  bags  used in  Amazon \nprime  now.  We  had  some  major  issues  with  the  current  design  such  as  bad  food  non-food \nsegregation  mechanism,  no  adequate  space  for  bar  code  labels,  dark  inner  color  of  the  bag, \nbag unable to stand upright i.e. be stable when kept in a trolley for picking order products etc. In \norder  to  solve  the  problems,  I  performed  a  cost  effectiveness  analysis  between  the  reusable \nbags  and  the  previously  used  brown  bags  as  a  result  of  which  reusable  bags  came  out  to  be \ncheaper.  I then  performed  one  on  one  interaction  with  various  on  field  employees  and  then \ncame up with solutions with the help of my manager. We introduced three pouches on the inner \nwalls  of  the  bag  (back,  left  and  right)  instead  of  the  previous  rigid  mid  partition.  We  also \ndedicated  spaces  for  bar  code  scanning  labels,  changed  the  inner  color  to  lime  yellow  for \nvisibility and gave a PVC cardboard support in the lower 25% of the bag to make it stand upright \ni.e. stable when kept in trolley for picking. I also improved the temperature sustainability of our \nchilled bags by providing better insulation and reducing the number of gel packs used. This also \nreduced the overall weight of the chilled bags. As my second project, I created a robust quality \nand  social  distancing audit  mechanism  for  Prime  now  that  helps  the  central  team  to  identify \nprocess  misses,  compliance  gaps  and  other  improvement  opportunities.  I  also  created  an \nautomated  tool  using  python  language  of  programming  (pandas  library)  to  automate  the  audit \nreport generation  process.  This  tool  reduced  the  time  required  for  report  generation  from  7-8 \nhours / week to 15-20 minutes / week. \n \n\n74 \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Jupyter  Notebook  (Python  and  Pandas),  Excel \nand other internal Amazon tools. \n \nObjectives of  the  project: The  objective  of  redesigning  reusable  bags  project  was  to  a \ncomprehensive analysis of cost difference of paper bags vs reusable bags and to identify gaps \nin  the  current  design  of  reusable  bags  and  come  up  with  a  better  design  to  resolve  all  these \nissues. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Negotiation  skills,  Excel,  Document  writing  in  Amazon,  Python \nlanguage of programming (Pandas library), Cost effectiveness analysis, Designing of products, \nAutomation of mechanical activities and Amazon's leadership principles. \n \nDetails  of  papers / patents: My  patent  for  the  bag  redesigning  project  consists  of  the \nintroduction of three pockets in the back, left and right inner sides of the bad instead of the mid \npartition, dedicated spaces for bar scanner labels, introduction of PVC cardboard at the bottom. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment in Amazon is great. Some of the key highlights from employees point of view are \nwork hours flexibility and dressing flexibility. Amazon corporate offices are greatly built and has \nsome great facilities for the employees. Other than this, the most unique part of Amazon's work \nculture is its 14 leadership principles defined by Jeff Bezos. It is fun to see how all Amazonians \nlive by these 14 principles on every action we perform. When it comes to the expectations from \nthe  company,  Amazon  expects  us  to  firstly  follow  these  14  leadership  principles  by  all  means \nand  then  perform  our  projects  efficiently.  Amazon  promises  to  be the  most  customer-centric \ncompany  ever  and  hence  we  start  with  our  customers,  with  customer  satisfaction  and  move \nbackwards. We in Amazon are a family and are consider each and every problem as our own. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Principles   of   managements,   Optimization, \nComputer programming, Object oriented programming and Technical report writing."

The task is to find the size building which is \nmost  cost-efficient  for  the  2 h delivery  model.  We  have  updated  the  design  principles  that \ndetermine  the  right  building  sizes.  The  result  is  the  size  of  a  building  that  would  minimize  the \ncost per unit and at the same time be feasible to be launched in the city regions. This building \nplan  has  evolved  over  the  former  model,  identifying  all  the  involved  costs.  The  work  also \nfocuses on how the cost change with the size of the building. \n2.Rate  Model - Business  requirement  sheets  (BRS)  provide  detailed  information  about  all  the \ndesign aspects of a specific building. They take in outbound volume as input and provide all the \n4Ms / Manpower / Shelving  as  cube etc.  as  an  output.  The  current  sheets  are  static  and  only \nportray  the  requirements  of  an  FC  for  a  given  outbound  volume.  The  idea  is  to  develop  a \ndynamic rate model using excel that would give all the elements and cost structure to make the \nFCs, depending on the Output and productivity. \n3.Ideal  Building  Costing  and  Sizing  (LPC) - There  are  two  types  of  buildings  in  the  UFF \nbusiness- FC  and  Hub / Live  Processing  centers  (LPC).  Taking  cues  from  the  methodology \nadopted for FCs, we have extended the model to Hub/LPCs. They are storage centers that are \npresent one leg before the Fresh FCs.  They also act as the processing centers for perishables \n(atta,  ice  creams),  and  fresh  produce  (fruits  &  vegetables)  including  the  tasks  of  grading, \nscaling, etc.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MS Excel, Amazon LMM tool,  Amazon PlayBook. \n \nObjectives of the project: The project covered three major deliverable that - 1.To arrive at the \nright  sizing  of  buildings  and  then  perform  costing  and  topology  analysis  for  a) Fulfillment \nCenters   b)Hub / Live processing centers   (LPC)   2.To   design   a   rate   model   of   building \nspecifications. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Supply chain management, Project management, Labor modelling, \nCost analysis and Topology analysis. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Confidential to Amazon. \n\n76 \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: As a part of the \ncurriculum  at  BITS  Pilani,  I  had  a  delightful  experience  in  the form  of  Practice  school (PS2) at \nthe Amazon Operations, Bangalore. I worked in the non-tech profile as an Operations manager \nintern in the supply chain execution team. We underwent a 10 day training at warehouses, sort \ncenters and delivery centers of Amazon to understand the core fundamentals of the processes. \nAfter  this, I performed  the learning by doing,  to  get  on  ground  training  of  GSF  (Special \nFulfillment) training. This lasted for almost 3 weeks and got hands on experience of handling a \nshift.  People  at  Amazon  are  helpful  and  friendly.  They  would  always  help  us  approach the \nproblem  instead  of  giving  direct  solutions.  They  also  make  sure  to  understand  the  business \ncontext of things. I tried out things, made mistakes and learned in the process. Amazon has an \ninclusive  work  culture  as  the  people  are  welcoming.

So, \nafter this, a new proposal for the procurement of 2D ring scanner is put forward. Next, from the \nanalysis  of  the  load  pattern,  a  new  layout  was designed  for  staging  purposes  of  shipments  of \ndifferent  locations,  but  the  implementation  has  been  halted  due  to  the  prevailing  COVID-19 \nsituation to check for the results. \nThe second project involved in extracting the data from various portals and then analyzing it to \nfind the impact of NC misses due to fluid and bag miss-staging.

Items that are accepted at the FC \nand  get  damaged  before  shipping  are  termed  as  warehouse  damage.  Warehouse  damage \ncosts  the  FC  in  terms  of  seller  reimbursements.  It  also  affects  ability  of  FC  in  delivering  the \ncustomer order within promised time. At the FC, the products are kept in shelves in small units \ncalled  bins.  A  bin had  physical  inventory  and  a  virtual  record  of  it.  When  a  customer  places \norder,  it  gets  attached  to  products  in  specific  bin,  and  only  that  bin  can  be  used  to  fulfill  it. \nHence,  it  is  critically  important  that  physical  items  and  virtual  records  agree  all  the  time.  A \nsource of mismatch in these is when a product falls down from a bin. This is called an amnesty \nitem.  Amnesty  costs  the  FC  in  terms  of  manpower  allocated  to  rectify  the  mismatch,  risk  to \ncustomer promise and possibility of product getting damaged due to the impact. In this project, I \nanalysed  various  processes in  FC  involving  inventory  movement.  From  this, I  found  out  1 \nstructural  improvement,  1  process  fail  points,  1  improvement  area  for  human  errors.  For  the \nprocess  fail  point,  I  recommended  a  tool  modification,  which  has  potential  to  reduce  25%  of \nwarehouse  damage.  From  the  improvement  process  of  human  errors,  we  are  seeing  ~30% \ndecrease  in  WD  in  that  process.  Also,  I  planned 1  structural  improvement  to  reduce  amnesty \nwhich would be acted upon in near future. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Excel, Powerpoint, SQL. \n \nObjectives of the project: Warehouse damage reduction, Amnesty reduction. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Managed  to  get  domain  knowledge  in  following  areas - Shift \nManagement,   Process   analysis,   Structural   improvement   implementation   planning,   Tool \ndesigning. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Nil. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: This is a field \njob.

I had to contribute as a regular team member which included \nwriting  design  documents,  analysing  and  comparing  various  technology  frameworks  and \nrecording the findings. The tech stack for mobile was primarily React Native coupled with Redux \nwritten in typescript. For web, we used React.

Amazon  faces  a  problem of  loss / theft  of  mobile \nphones  in  it's  supply / delivery  chain.  To  mitigate  this  problem,  this  project  aimed  at  digitally \nlocking / unlocking  mobile  phones  when  they  are  in  transit  so  that  even  if  they  are  stolen,  the \nmobile phones are not usable. My  work was to implement a backend automated workflow that \nwould be triggered by events such as delivery event, return event, etc. and perform operations \non remote devices through API calls for locking / unlocking them. The project was implemented \nonly  for  Samsung  mobile  phones  as  currently,  only  Samsung  provides  the  functionality  to \ndigitally lock mobile phones through their Knox program. The project consisted of a forward leg \nin which the phone is ordered through Amazon and delivered to the customer and a reject leg in \nwhich  a  phone  order  is  rejected  by  the  customer  and  it  is  returned  back  to  an  Amazon  FC. \n\n116 \n \nSamsung  Knox  required  that  the  phone  was  enrolled  in  their  database  before  any  locking / \nunlocking operations, so the forward leg requirement was to enroll the mobile phone when it is \nout  for  delivery  and  unenroll  it  when  it  is  delivered  to  the  customer.  Also,  if  the  phone  is  not \ndelivered within 10 days from the day it was shipped, it is considered lost or stolen and it has to \nbe locked. In the reject leg, when the phone starts it's journey back to the warehouse, it has to \nbe locked and then it is unlocked when it reaches the warehouse. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java, AWS tools such as SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, \nCloudFormation, CloudWatch, Lambda, CDK, S3, etc. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  design  an  automated  workflow \nthat  gets  triggered  on internal  Amazon  events  such  as  delivery  event, reject  event,  etc.  and \nperforms  operations  on  remote  devices  to  digitally  lock  and unlock  them  when  they  are  in \ntransit. \nMajor learning outcomes: Proficiency in  Java,  Dagger,  Junit,  Design  patterns, Proficiency  in \nAWS tools such as DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Lambda. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief   description   of   working environment,   expectations   from   the   company: In   my \ninternship at Amazon, I felt more like a full-time SDE taking an active part in my team's projects \nand   day-to-day   tasks.   Team   members   were   extremely   helpful   and   inclusive.   I   had   an \nexponential  learning  curve  because  all  the  tools  were  new  to  me.  However,  there  was  a  lot of \npressure from the manager for completing the project as it this project had a significant business \nimpact and a very strict timeline. I had to work outside regular office hours to get the work done. \nInterns at Amazon are expected to learn quickly (even faster than FTEs) and deliver projects in \na short time. I got the opportunity to work on the most interesting projects in the team and using \nthe  latest  technology.

The first project involved externalisation of Amazon tools to the public network with \nadded  security  so  that  they  could  be  used  in  the  3PL  warehouses.  This  included  a  lot  of \ncomputer networking concepts like request, ports, vips and infrastructure creation as well. I got \nto externalise a tool whose architecture had to be changed from Middleman Ruby to Java spring \nbecause  the  backend  couldn't  be  externalised  due  to  security  concerns.  I  got  the  exposure  to \ndevelop  the  spring  application  from  scratch.  The  second  project  revolved  around  adding  RTL \nsupport to an application to render content in Arabic locale when chosen. This involved working \non the frontend including JSP, Apache tiles, CSS and HTML. The third project was development \nof an android application in Kotlin using the FIDO2 API to authenticate warehouse associates. \nThis was another great learning experience since I had no knowledge whatsoever about android \nand its functioning. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java spring MVC, JavaScript, JSP, AWS, Kotlin, \nAndroid. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: 1.

These need to abide by a set of regulations set by global \n\n140 \n \ngoverning  bodies. To  check  their  compliance,  every  creative  needs to go  through  a \"checklist\" \nand a human reviewer answers each question, which can be quite dull and arduous. \nMy task during this internship, was to build a tool where this process can become easier. So, \n1.  I  first  added  some  new functionalities  to  the  VC  (Version  Control)  tool  that  helps  reviewers \ncompare different versions of a creative. \n2.  I  wrote  code  for  Comment-Interpretation,  so  as  to  automatically  check  if  the  previously \nmarked corrections have been made. \n3. I built the platform for automated MCR. Here, the checklist is suppressed (based on metadata \nand the responses to a questionnaire), then data elements are extracted from the creative and \nthe checklist is re-prioritized.

The \nregistration of a drug product in the emerging markets and the ROW markets is being done to \nmake  the  drugs  available.  But  here  comes  the  challenge, where  the  drugs  that  has  been \nregistered  is  not  available  in  the  market  on  the  date  that  is  mentioned  by  the  regulatory \nauthority. This phenomenon is called as drug lag and this mostly occurs after the registration of \ndrug  in  a  particular  market  and  then its  non-availability.  This  project  focuses  on  the  factors \nmainly responsible for this lag, its reasons (manufacturer lag, application lag, regulatory lag and \nthe drug lag thesis) and different regulatory strategies that can be used to minimize the drug lag, \nalong  with  the  non-regulatory  strategies.  The  method  that  has  been  opted  here  is  review  of \nseveral regulatory information from websites of regulatory agency and past experience from the \norganization.

Later,  I  wrote  a  custom  lint  rule  for  a  pattern  not  picked  up  by  any \nexisting rules. It was pretty cool, since I had to identify the pattern by traversing the AST. These \nexercises  also  helped  me  understand  React,  the  codebase  and  frontend  development  in \ngeneral.

I  reduced  code  complexity,  response \ntime  and  memory  footprint  across  the  board.

These mechanism have an overhead on performance while trading off the savings. \nThe impact of this overhead can be reduced by tuning the parameters of efficiency techniques \nlike compression, deduplication and compaction. \nMy project title was \"Cold To Hot Data Migration\". Data blocks are categorized as cold (inactive) \nand hot (active), based on this categorization efficiency policies are implemented. But due to the \ndynamic nature of the data, this categorization also changes. Cold to Hot data migration is one \nsuch instance in which the cold data which is compressed heavily becomes hot. To improve the \nrandom read performance, we perform the graceful migration by converting the compression to \na  format  which  incurs  less  overhead  while  reading  the  data  block.  The  selection  of  such  data \nblocks  is  also  important  as  it  must  pay  off  the  time  invested  during  the  migration  process  in \nfuture  reads.

Initially all spans were colored using correlation id and graph id.   \n? Now all kernels with same name are colored with same color and also we have single color for \nall memcpy and memset. \n? Also  categorized  Run-time  and  Driver  based  APIs  into  different  types  and  assigned  a  color \nbased on the type to which they belong. \nWhy to update the coloring scheme? \n? Correlation Id is a sequentially incrementing number given to each CUDA API executed in a \nprocess. \n? The  coloring  did  not  give  any significant  information  apart  from  just  separating  adjacent \nactivities. \nShow GPU ranges for NVTX for easy correlation to kernel. \n• Initially our tool used to show NVTX ranges of CPU. \n• Using  list  of  correlation  ids  corresponding  to  run  time  apis  and  driver  apis, I  found \ncorresponding start and end times with respect to GPU by using map between those apis and \nkernels. \n\n413 \n \n• Now it can show both GPU and CPU ranges for NVTX. \nWhy do we need NVTX GPU ranges? \n• Highlight  feature  was  used  to  correlate  the  NVTX  CPU  range  to  corresponding  kernels  and \nmemcpy launched on GPU. \n• The  issue  was  that  CPU  range  can  be  far  apart  from  the  GPU  activities  to  see  in  the  same \nview. \n• Converting  CPU  ranges  to  GPU  range  enables  easy  correlation  of  NVTX  ranges  with  GPU \nactivities. \n   \nString table optimizations \nInitially, the tooltips for all spans were having lot of information which was using lot of memory. \nNow, these  spans  data  would  be  stored  into  array  of  structures  which  would  be  decoded  in \njavascript plugin which would be assigned according to type of span.  \nEncoding part is done in utility which is in native c++ code these structures are exported to java \nscript  plugin  which  would  decode  each  field  of  information  into  respective  span  field  hence \nreducing the memory usage. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Visual studio code. \n \nObjectives of the project: Updating coloring schemes for spans, Show GPU ranges for nvtx for \neasy correlation to kernel, string table optimizations. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: C, C++, JavaScript, Data structures and algorithms. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company: Work \nenvironment was very good.

These tests are written to verify the different functionalities of the context switching \nunit and the various safety features implemented to make it industry functional safety standard \ncompliant. A bug / error is caught when running regressions of such tests on the main unit (DUT \n– Device  under Test),  in  our  case  the  Context  switch  unit.  There  were  many  types  of  debugs \nthat were  performed.  In  many  cases  the  error  was  found  to  be  in  the  tests  (test  not  correctly \nanticipating  the  behavior  of  the  DUT  under  certain  conditions).  In  numerous  cases, the  debug \nprocess resulted in corrections in the design of the microcode. Sometimes, a bug may also be \nfound  at  the  RTL  code  level  in  which  case  appropriate  changes  need  to  be  made  in  the  RTL \ncode. The  extensive  debugging  process  also  lead  to  more  and  more  clarity  of  the  unit  and  its \nbasic  functionalities.  Continuous  study  of  the  internal  architecture  and  verification  specification \ndocuments in parallel aided the learning process. \nOther  than  debugging  tasks,  many  coverage  tasks  were  also  completed.  As  per  requirements \nfor functional  safety,  its  important that  our testbench  covers  all  the sections  of  the  DUT,  i.e  all \npossible scenarios are hit. This ensures every line of the DUT code is hit at-least once to ensure \nthere  are  NO  blind  spots  in  the  DUT  design.  The  same  testcases  written  for  functional \nverification can also be modified to include scenarios to hit boundary cases that may not get HIT \nin  the  normal  course  of  the  GPU / unit’s operation. Separate directed test sequences were \ncreated  to  hit  corner  cases.  A  cumulative  report  gets  generated  in  the  end  which  gives  a \ncomprehensive evaluation of line as well as conditional code coverage. It marks the section of \nDUT code which were not hit by the tests. In which case, a further analysis needs to be done, \nas to why / what lead to this. And an appropriate stimulus or a checker needs to be added to Hit \nthe missed cases. Many times, a MISS may occur due to some corner case inside a loop which \nnever  gets  hit.  Such  cases  are  solved  by  implementing  a  checker  in  test  to  hit  that  case  by \nspecifically sending a particular argument to that code snippet. \nFinally, a lot of experience was gained while  working upon these tasks while at the same time \nenjoying it due to the detective like nature of the work. Finding out bugs, solving them and at the \nsame time meet deadlines to contribute to the team working towards a common goal was very \nexciting as well as enlightening. \n \n\n416 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Verdi wave viewer, Perforce version management \nsystem, NVBUGS bug tracking system. \n \nObjectives of the project: To achieve functional safety compliance of the context switching unit \nof Nvidia GPUs for automotive applications. \n \nMajor   learning outcomes: Functional   verification   and   testing   methodology.

NOC  have  an  advantage  of  meeting  the  needs  like \nscalability, physical routing feasibility at the same time they don’t compromise on the speed. \nArchitectures today implement different open standard AMBA protocols as they help seamlessly \nintegrating peripherals from different vendors with the proprietary systems. To avoid re-spins in \nthe  design, VLSI  design  flow  demands  a  step  known  as  design  verification.  Design  cycle  of  a \nsemiconductor  chip  involves  thoroughly  verifying  its  functionality.  My  work  at  Qualcomm \n\n492 \n \ninvolved verifying the bus architectures of mobile system processors. To thoroughly verify all the \nfunctionality,  functional  coverage  in  enabled  wherein  we  create  different  test  scenarios  and \nprovide  different  stimulus  to  ensure  that  all  the  functionalities  are  covered  and  verified.  This \nprocess  help  in  catching  RTL  bugs  at  very  early  stage. Another  design  verification  metric  is \ntoggle  coverage  which  is  done  at  the  final  stage  of  the  design  cycle.  Toggle  coverage \nenablement  helps  in  catching  bugs  due  to  data  corruption  and  ports  being  tied  to  incorrect \nvalues which may not be caught during the functional verification. Another task included writing \nassertions  and  developing  checkers  to  verify  different  features  in  NOC.  Assertions  remain \nclosely tied to the RTL and continuously keep monitoring the design functionality even when the \nmain focus of simulation has shifted from the design functionality. So, design verification plays \nan important role in avoiding chip re-spins and reduces NRE. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Synopsys  Verdi,  Systemverilog,  UVM,  Assertion \nbased verification. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Finding  and  reporting  RTL  bugs,  thoroughly  exercising  different \nstimulus combination to verify different functionality. \n \nMajor  learning outcomes: Functional  verification  at  SOC  level,  ARM  bus  protocols  and \nverification tools and technology. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Expectation:  \nThe organization expects students to have knowledge in HDL and HVL languages. Knowledge \nof UVM can be of additional help since all the test bench used in industry in developed in UVM. \nKnowledge  of  C  language  is  also  a  fundamental  requirement.  The  organization  expects \nstudents to develop debugging skills as they work through the project.  \nWorking  Environment:  The  working  environment  at  Qualcomm  is  quite  positive  and  lively. \nThough tight project schedules demand long working hours there is lot of fun events like team \noutings,  games,  etc.  which  happen.  Training  is  given  utmost  importance  and  sessions  are \narranged  frequently  for  employees  to  develop  new  skills.  Since, most  my  internship  was  done \nvirtually   due   to   COVID-19, we   were   provided   with   adequate   hardware   support   and \nreimbursements for internet charges to cover our expenses.  \n\n493 \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: VLSI  design,  VLSI test  & testablility,  VLSI \narchitecture."

So, in this task, \nthe initial calculations comprises of calculation of no. of RE’S acquired by LTE channels (csrs, \nsss, pss, pbch) and no. of RE’s acquired by SSB (combination of sss, pss  and  pbch)  and \nCoreset 0 (Pdcch 0) in 5G NR. So as a final result, it is proved that SSB and Coreset 0 played a \ncrucial role in 5G NR, as in this less RE (resources) were acquired by them compared to more \nRE acquired by LTE channels. The major reason was CSRS was not here in NR due to which \nthe saved RE’s were utilized  for  data  instead  of physical  layer  channels, which  indirectly  gave \nrise to more throughput (data rate) in NR and less bandwidth wastage as compared to LTE. As \nan  add  on    some  simulations  of  LTE  modules  was  done  on  NS3  software,  from  which  the \nresultant plots like  path loss effect v/s increasing distance of UE (user) from enB, sinr  effect v/s \nincreasing distance of UE (user) from enB were observed. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): LTE downlink resource element visualization tool, \nmatlab, Ns3 software. \n \nObjectives of the project: ESTIMATION OF OVERHEAD DUE TO REFERENCE SIGNALS IN \nLTE & NR BASED NETWORKS. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understood overhead due to Reference signals resource elements \n(REs) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) networks. At physial layer, reference / \npilot signals are used for control, signaling and synchronization tasks accurately computing the \noverhead REs is necessary to achieve an efficient system design. The current study is aimed at \nexploring  the  influence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  downlink  performance.  Current  work  modelled \nall  overheads  for  synchronization,  controlling  and signaling  operations  in  LTE/NR  physical \ndownlink  shared / control channels.  This  allows  for  dynamically  computing  the  useful  REs  (by \nsubtracting  the  overhead  REs  from  the  total  ones),  both  per  Transmission  Time  Interval  (TTI) \nand  per  frame  (and  hence,  the  corresponding  bit  rates).  Our  data  rate-based  performance \nmodel is able to accurately compute the real, exact system data rate or “throughput” (instead of \napproximations). Aiming at understanding the impact of each overhead mechanism, carried out \na  variety  of  simulations and  the  simulation  results  prove  our  starting  hypothesis  that  the \ninfluence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  performance  should  not  be  neglected.

There is a need to \nreduce  this  period  by  making  available the  Inspection  data  at  the  very  starting  stage  to  the \ndesigner so that it will be easier for the designer to make decisions while deciding the tolerance \nvalues  for  a  process.  This  can  be  done  by  storing  the  product  data  and  corresponding \ninspection data in a common database and using this data for decision making with the help of \ndifferent Machine learning techniques. This project work focussed on developing and integrating \na  module  into  SIEMENS  NX,  such  that  recommendation  on  dimensioning  and  tolerancing  can \nbe  provided  to  help  in  predictive  modeling.  Multiple  prototypes  were  developed  for  predictive \nmodelling  as  spread  across  as different  NX  applications  like  modelling, assembly, inspection \nand  CMM. Improved  modelling  and  tolerancing  tools  and  user  control tools  to  achieve  them \nhave  been  discussed.

It takes  a  2V  DC  input  and \ngenerates  a  regulated  output  of  8V  DC.  The  charge  pump  is  supported  by  a  clock  signal  of  a \nperiod  of  40ns.  There  are essentially  three  functional  blocks  in  a  charge  pump  system, clock-\ngenerator circuit, charge pump and a comparator. The comparator block consists of a two-stage \nOTA. Since, in a comparator design, high gain is very essential, therefore, the two-stage OTA is \ndesigned.  Opamp  compensation  is  carried  out  to  make  sure  the  closed  loop  configuration  is \nstable.  It  also  leads  to  good  settling  characteristics.  Two  most  popular  approaches  are \ndominant-pole compensation and lead compensation. In the four-phase clock generator circuit, \nfour clock signals are generated, out of which two are overlapping signals and the other two are \nnon-overlapping   signals.  The   overlapping   signals   are  the   inverted   versions  of   the   non-\noverlapping  ones.  Charge  pump  is  a  kind  of  DC–DC  converter  that  consists  capacitors  and  a \nswitch  network  controlled  by  some  clock  signals  only.  A  high  potential,  either  positive  or \nnegative, can be generated by the charge sharing actions among different capacitors during two \nor more  clock  phases.  Conventionally,  this  kind  of  circuits  was  implemented  using  diode-\nconnected NMOS switch network.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Cadence virtuoso and Finesim. \n\n605 \n \nObjectives of the project: • The significance of a charge pump system in memory circuits. \n• The working of a charge pump system and its functional blocks. \n• Understanding the process of designing circuits to achieve stability of a complex system. \n \nMajor learning  outcomes: • Understanding  various  concepts  of  analog  integrated circuit \ndesign. \n• Designing  stable  analog circuits  like,  two-stage  OTA,  clock-generator  circuit,  charge  pump, \netc. across all process corners. \n• Learning basic level scripting to access files from various directories. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Western Digital \n(SANDISK)  sets  out  to  achieve  its  goals  in  ethical,  honest  ways  with  an  elevated  sense  of \npurpose.

Hence, there  is  a \nneed to use data science (DS) and a lot of proxies to ensure the sanctity of the data. This is at \nthe core of any data-led platform from a revenue standpoint. I was working with DS engineering \nteam   whose   job   was   to   ensure   end   to   end   deployment   of   DS   models.   I   worked   on \nimplementation  of  new  id  resolution  method  and  built  a  pipeline  for  performance  comparison. \nApart  from  this, there  were  some  other  small  tasks  allocated  like  optimising  pipelines  and \nimplementing workflow schedulers. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Scala,  Apache  spark,  Gremlin,  JanusGraph, \nScyllaDB, Airflow. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: To  ensure  that  the  quality / consistency of  the  identity  graph  is \nmaintained as the company scales the number of data partners. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: I got to explore the field of big data (using Spark), learned a hybrid \nprogramming  language  (FP+OOP)  Scala,  graph  querying  language  (Gremlin), indexing  in \ndatabases and workflow scheduling. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: NA. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: While working \nat  Zeotap,  I  got  to  experience  the  startup  culture.  I  was  given  the  sole  ownership  for \nimplementation  of  the  project  while  collaborating  with  DS  and  product  team.

The  project's  goal  is  to  delete  unused  IDs  for \nbetter data quality and reduce storage costs. Additional tasks include, \nMigration from Oozie to airflow where I had to recreate an existing Oozie workflow which used \nxml using airflow in Python. \nFixing aerospike deletion in DryRun mode which was a bug in the code which caused aerospike \ndeletion when run in dry run mode to give incorrect outputs. \nAdded  support  to  output  ID  profile  reports  which  was  an  additional  feature  to  the  primary \npipeline. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Scala, Spark, Python, Airflow. \n \nObjectives of the project : Identifying the IDs with low chances of survival to calculate reports \non how it would effect the volume of IDs and the data related to these IDs if deleted. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Software development, End to end pipeline of code deployment, Big \ndata, Data engineering. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment, expectations  from  the  company: Th  company \nprovided  a  very  work-friendly  environment.
