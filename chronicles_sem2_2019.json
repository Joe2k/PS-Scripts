Currently  modelling  is  being  done  by  extracting  online  data, \nfollowed by modelling of this offline data. The developed model is then applied on the process. \nThus,  it  would  be  efficient  if  modelling  would  be  done  online.  Regression  techniques that  are \nused for online estimation and control generally yield poor models if the data is not rich enough. \nIn this report a modified block-wise dynamic recursive PLS technique that is based on selection \nof  rich  data  has  been  studied  for  online  adaptation and  control.  Because  of  its  ability  to \naccommodate a wider range of forgetting factors, the technique is found to track the dynamics \nof slow as well as fast changes in the processes. The reviewed algorithm has been studied with \nrespect to the carbon black process. In an effort to self-tune the carbon black process, a deeper \nunderstanding of the reviewed technique has been done by reviewing the basic techniques such \nas  Principle  component  analysis,  partial  least  square  technique  and  recursive  partial  least \nsquare  technique  along  with  an  in-depth  review  of  the  carbon  black  process  itself.  The \nmethodology  towards  achieving  the  goal  of  self-tuning  has  also  been  proposed  along  with  a \nfuture vision to attain more clarity. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : matlab, ms office, origin \n \nObjectives of the project : • To understand Regression and its different types   • To  understand \ndata analysis • To study different self tuning methods and their algorithm • To    analyze    Matlab \ncodes for previously developed tuning methods • To  develop  a  Matlab  code for  self  tuning of \ncarbon black process (mainly reactor) • To  model  the  real  time  plant  dataset  using  Partial \nLeast square Regression and  Modified Partial Least square Regression . • To compare \ntheir predictive capability. \n \n\n37 \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : • The  modification  made  in  the  forgetting  factor  calculation \ngives better results. \n• Month by month addition of new datasets allows us to view change in model adaptation. \n• From the given graphs it can be concluded that  Modified Block-wise Recursive PLS is \nbetter at model adaptation as compared to Partial Least Square Regression because: \no Model adaptation is faster \no Error from the actual values is smaller. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company :  \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Process Modelling"

It  has  a  data  of  different  attributes  related  to  pharma  and \n\n68 \n \nsome  FMCG  products  and  Ascent  had  a  data  for  around  2.2  lakh  products.  The  entire  data \nrelated to these products are stored in Master Data Management (MDM). So different distributer \nand retailers have their own data base where they can record details of products but MDM as a \nmaster maintains the data of each product with a unique code to each product, MDM acts as a \nsingle source of truth by standardizing the data and incorporated rules in order to find incorrect \ndata, new rules are made with some logics and algorithms to find the incorrect data and helps to \nidentify  the  products  with  issues,  these  products  with  issues  should  be  cleaned  by  Data \nGovernance Team (DGT), along with cleaning process DGT also works on Mapping, Levelling, \nQuality Checks etc. The data in MDM should be validated by some professionals so as a part of \nDRX-Doctor’s  Program  doctors  are  hired  to  validate  required  data  in  MDM.  MDM  system  is \ncritical  for  analytics,  financial  reporting,  customer  management,  customer  care,  compliance, \nproduct regulatory adherence, cross-selling and up-selling between the warehouses and ensure \nsmooth supply chain management .Finally, Resource Scoring Framework was done in order to \nstandardize  the  Data  governance  team  to  give  One  Agent  One  Score  (OAOS).  OAOS  was \nimplemented  based  on  the  performance  of  each  member  by  considering  few  parameters  of \neach team member such as Quality, Efficiency, Adherence, Utilization, Knowledge etc. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : SQL, DATA EDO, AWS \n \nObjectives of the project : To help in building a better medicine master by getting doctors as \nconsultants and work with Data Governance Team in order to improve the quality of the data we \nhave  and  help  to  build  a  robust  and  through  validation  layer  of  Master  Data  Management.  To \ncreate  new  Health  Metric  tests to  improve  the  quality  of  the  data  in  Master  Data  Management \n(MDM).  Creation  of  Resource  Scoring  framework  based  on  the  performance  of  the  team \nmember of Data Governance Team. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : • DATA  EDO  is  a  tool  where  I  had  written  the  table  and \ncolumn description to each attribute related to products and their related entity. Which acts as a \nmeta data helps for internal purposes and for third party. \n• I  had  written  STANDARD  OPERATING  PROCEDURES  (SOP)  for  the  validation  of \nattributes which helps the DGT team to understand the procedure for validation of attributes. \n• I had written the reference documents for the 2 attributes which helps the DGT team to \nrefer the documents for further reference. \n\n69 \n \n• Came  up  with  the  new  Health  Metric  test  which  helps  the  DGT  team  to  identify  the \nmanufacturer, measurement, schedule related details. \n• As  a  part  of  DRX- Program  onboarded  4  doctors  as  a  consultant  to  the  organisation \nwhich helps the DGT team in validating the data. \n• Guided Quality Check Team and Cleared a small concepts to them and helped them to \nminimise the products failing Health metric. \n• Making  dashboards  helps  the  DGT  team  to  understand  the  complete  data  on  sight. \nMaking this dashboard twice a week which give the summary of the entire data. \n• Recently started working on resource framework i.e One Agent One Score (OAOS) and \ncontinuously working on it to improve and standardise this. Helps to understand the area where \nthe agent is really week and helps management to give training to a agent in a particular area. \nThis is at a pilot level and will expand soon. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment is really good and can really learn new things \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : DOSAGE FORM DESIGN"

To  accomplish  this,  we \ndescribe a novel “semantic infusion” method, which infuses special marker strings in the word \nvector space of the text, in order to locate these trending terms. We also demonstrate the power \nof  our  method  by  comparing  its  results  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  with  those  of  a  well-\nestablished  algorithm,  the  Online  Processing  Variant  of  LDA.  We  outline  a  few  industrial \napplications for our method which were tested so far. We then shift our focus to a different area \nof interest at Bosch: prediction of product recall incidents from complaints data of automobiles. \nIn  this  task,  we  focus  on  developing  a  usable  dataset,  using  a  set  of  rules  applied  to  existing \ncomplaint and recall data. We build a deep neural network classifier, pass this dataset to it, and \naim to predict if a complaint against an automobile will result in its recall or not. We provide our \nresults and a short analysis of our observations from it. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Python, Keras library, Word2Vec \n \nObjectives of the project : 1) Develop an automated method of extracting the trends from the \ncorpus by introducing the concept of semantic trends.  2)  Compare semantic trend results with \nthe results of a well-established trend analysis algorithm, Online Processing Variant of LDA, to \nestablish  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  improvement  of  the  semantic  infusion  technique.  3) \nDevelop  a  classifier, specifically  a  bidirectional  Long  Short-Term  Memory  to  identify  whether  a \ncomplaint is severe enough to warrant a recall of the product.  4) Prepare a dataset which can \nbe directly used by the classifier, and observe how the predictive power of the model changes \nwhen it is trained with data from different time window sizes. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : 1)  Performing  experiments  to  test  the  quality  of  results  from  an \nalgorithm.  \n2) Documenting the complete project into a paper for a conference. \n3) Preparing a dataset from existing resources to supply to a classifier.  \n4) Building a deep learning model to classify text. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : Submitted a paper to CIKM 2019. \n \n\n81 \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment  was  relaxed.

This \ncommand  sends  a  HTTP request  to the rest-endpoint  and  the  rest-endpoint  in  turn  sends  it  to \nthe  smf-service  via  gRPC.  After  this  I  dealt  with  the  show  subscriber  command.  The  fact  that \nthis  command  ends  up calling  all  other  microservices  and  that  it  aggregates  all  the  responses \nbefore sending it to the command line user made it trickier. At this point my mentor noticed that \nhaving rest-endpoint accumulate the results from other microservice is overloading it. He asked \n\n120 \n \nme to shift the clear and show subscriber commands' processing to nodemgr, a relatively  less \nloaded microservice. After the code migration, I worked on the fetch IP Pool info command. The \ncommand  fetches  information  like  the  network  IP  address,  number  of  free  IPv4  and  IPv6 \naddresses  left  etc.  from  nodemgr.

As Futures First trades futures of energy, commodities \nand fixed income they need tools to analyze the markets and make quick decisions. To improve \ntheir decision making process by adding the layer of data analysis, they were eager to develop \nmodels based on market data like open interest and net positioning and machine learning. Of all \nthe completed projects, I would like to describe two projects - Rollover analysis for commodities \nand energy and Back-testing of candlestick patterns. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Python, scikit, pandas, Excel, VBA \n \nObjectives of the project : Objective of Rollover analysis for commodities and energy was to \nuse modelling techniques to help estimate next month’s spread features like mean value, range \nand direction of move of spread prices. Objective for Back-testing of candlestick patterns was to \ntest how effective reversal patterns (hammer, shooting star, engulfing and morning/evening star) \nare by quantifying the amount of retracement. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : The  main  learning  outcome  was  to  understand the  market \ndynamics  for  commodities  and  energy.  Interaction  with  the  energy  researcher  helped  in \nunderstanding  the  supply  and  demand  dynamics  of  the  energy  markets.  Interaction  with \ncommodities  researcher  helped  me  realize  the  role  of  market  positioning  to predict  future \nmoves. Also I learnt about sources for obtaining information about the commodities market like \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission’s CIT report and the US Dept of Agriculture website. \n \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : NA \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company : The company \nstructure  was  very  flat  and  the  management  interacted  with  the  traders  and  researchers \n\n173 \n \nregularly.

The  constant \ninteraction  between  researchers  and  traders  helped  them  clarify  and  formulate  the  trading \nsignals.  There  were  two  types  of  interns - traders  and  researchers.  The  trading  interns  were \ngiven the opportunity to trade live with $2000 and the research interns used to sit beside senior \nresearchers and learn from them. The work environment offered by the company is conducive \nto  learning  for  the  student,  enabling  them  to  achieve  their  potential.

The  objective  of  the \ncurrent study was twofold (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient between finger and glass substrate using the strain gauge-based sensor. The role of \ndifferent  parameters  such  as  stroke  frequency,  Uni  vs  bi-directional  stroke, static  friction  was \nstudied. Protocol parameters were recommended to better differentiate the systems with smaller \ndifference  in  COF.    (2)  the  second  part  of  the  work  focuses  on  the  impact  of  different  factors \nsuch  as  surfactant  types,  pH,  alkalinity,  viscosity,  ionic  strengths  and  skin  hydration  on  the \nfriction  coefficient.  Ionic  and  nonionic  surfactants  were  chosen  for  the  study,  namely:  (a) \nAnionic:  NaLAS,  SDS,  SLES,  MES,  SLI,  (b)  Cationic:  CPC,  CTAB,  (c)  Zwitterionic:  CAPB  and \n(d) Non-ionic: EO7 and Lutensol XL 60. Non-ionic surfactant showed higher frictional coefficient. \nAmong  the  anionic  surfactants,  the  COF  trends  were  SDS<Na-LAS<  MES=SLES<SLI.  The \ntrend  was  explained  using  the  CMC  and  packing  parameter  of  surfactants  at  the  air/water \ninterface.  Cationic  and  anionic  surfactants  of  comparable  CMC  showed  similar  COF.  pH \nexperiments showed COF was primarily governed by the reserved alkalinity of the system and \nnot the pH. E.g., for same pH, sodium carbonate gave lower COF than sodium hydroxide. Skin \nhydration  shows  a  maximum  in  COF.  Viscosity  decreased  the  COF  which  was  in  line  with  the \n\n189 \n \nlearning  from  Stribeck  curve  that  the  viscosity  increase  shifts  the  lubrication  regime  from \nboundary to hydrodynamic regime. \n \nTool   used   (Development   tools - H/w,   S/w) : Strain  gauge  load  cell   based   sensors, \nfluorescence spectrometer, dynamic surface tensiometer, python and Matlab codes for analysis \n \nObjectives of the project : (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient  between  finger and  glass  substrate  using  the  strain  gauge-based  sensor.  (2)  the \nsecond part of the work focuses on the impact of different factors such as surfactant types, pH, \nalkalinity, viscosity, ionic strengths and skin hydration on the friction coefficient. \n \nMajor Learning  Outcomes : Physical  basis  of  friction  between  skin  and  counter  surface, \nmethods  of  analysis  of  data  sets,  complexity  of  skin  in  physical  phenomenon  of  friction, \nchemical modification of skin in presence of surfactant, role of surfactants in lubrication, regimes \nof lubrication \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Number  of \ndriven  individuals  working  in  a  variety  of  distinct  but  overall  limited  field.

These  models  are  used  for  both  heating  and  cooling \napplications.  Micro-channel  Heat  Exchanger(MCHX)  is  used  in  the  indoor  side  of  these  units. \nMCHX  is  either  used  as  an  evaporator  or  an  condenser  depending whether  the  heat  pump \nsystem  is  in  cooling  or  heating  mode  respectively.  The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  increase  the \ncapacity  of  MCHX.  It  is  achieved  by  increasing  the  air  side  Heat  transfer  Coefficient.

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : Project Work: My internship project is \"BLE Mesh \nFriend feature\" which is implemented in MATLAB using OOPS concepts. During the start of my \nproject, I learned about Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Mesh. In order \nto maintain the low power consumption of BLE, Bluetooth mesh introduced friend feature. Then, \nI read about friend feature at transport layer in \"Mesh Profile\" Bluetooth Specification v1.0.1. For \nlow  power  nodes  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which  receive  data  less  frequently, \nthe  amount  of  time  that  they  need  to  listen  is  limited  by  establishing  friendship  between  low \npower   nodes   and   friend   nodes.   Did   literature   survey   on   how   to   compute   the   energy \nconsumption  and  lifetime  of  low  power  nodes  in  Bluetooth  mesh  network.  The  functionality  of \nnodes  with  low  power  feature  and friend feature is  developed  at  the  transport  layer. The  timer \nfunctionality is developed to maintain the timers for low power node and friend node. The timer \nfunctionality  is  integrated  with  the  low  power  feature  and  friend  feature  functionality.  Normal \nBluetooth mesh node functionality is implemented in the transport layer in addition to low power \nand friend feature functionalities.  In this project, the average current consumption and lifetime \nof  Bluetooth  mesh  low  power  node  is  computed.  Also,  the  average  time  statistics  of  different \nBluetooth mesh nodes are compared, and it is observed that, low power node is in sleep state \nfor most of the time which results in more lifetime of the low power node.  \n\n250 \n \nOther Activities: Improved coding skills in MATLAB by doing Cody. Improved company needed \nskills by frequent interactions with the manager and mentor. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : S/w: MATLAB \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : Develop  friend  functionality  to  conserve  the  energy  of  Bluetooth \nmesh  low  power  node  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which receive  data  less \nfrequently.  The  energy  is  conserved  by  limiting  the  amount  of  time  that  the  low  power  nodes \nneed  to  listen. This  can be  achieved  by  establishing friendship  between  low  power  nodes  and \nfriend nodes. Once friendship is established, friend node stores messages that are addressed to \nthe  low  power  node  and  are  delivered  to  the  low  power  node  when  it  explicitly  requests  the \nfriend node. Also, friend node relays messages on behalf of low power node. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learned  new  concept called  Bluetooth  mesh  introduced  in \nBluetooth  5.0.  Learned  how  to  design  friend  functionality  and  its  timers  using  OOPS  in \nMATLAB. Learned about unit testing by testing the friend functionality at the transport layer and \nintegration  testing  by  testing  the friend  functionality  after  integration  with  other  layers  of  mesh \nsystem architecture. Learned about how devices are simulated in real-time. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment is peaceful and enthusiastic.

The purpose of \ndoing synthesis is to convert the RTL code of module to technology dependent optimized netlist, \nit minimizes the slack to meet the timing performance and also, it minimizes area and leakage \npower.  In  this  project,  synthesis  of  a  module  has  been  performed  using  Synopsys  Design \nCompiler. After applying appropriate constraints on a module, slack has been minimized to 0ns \nfrom 1.586ns and leakage power has been minimized to 1.652μW. \nAlso,  the  other  part  of  work  includes  clock  domain  crossing  (CDC)  check  which  has  been \nperformed on chip top level using Questa CDC tool. The intention of performing CDC check on \nchip top level is to make sure that the data exchange between different clock domains is smooth \nand functionally  correct.

I learnt how coding standards are \nin an industrial environment. Modulation of the code is of utmost importance. This is because a \nmajor concern of the institutions is scalability of the code. The code should remain usable even \nafter  a  particular  person  is  off  the  project.  It  should  be  understandable  to  everyone.  Thus, \nvariable  names,  packages,  documentation  etc. need  to follow  certain  rules  as  specified  by  the \ncompany. \nIn an industrial environment, essional conduct is also of a lot of importance. PS-II gave me an \nexposure  to  this  area  as  well.  Addressing  your  colleagues  and  documenting  all  conversations \nvia emails is very important in a work environment. \n\n281 \n \nAs it was my first exposure to IT culture and this programme helped me in every possible way to \nmake transition from an all-academic environment to an industrial environment. Five and a half \nmonths is optimum time to get acquainted with these changes. PS-II broadened my knowledge \nand boosted a lot of confidence in me. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Linux, Ansible, SSH, Flask, AWS-SAM, SignalFx, \nBootstrap, Celery \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : 1)  Automate  the  process  of  VM  provisioning,  2)  Add  SignalFx \nmetrics for SLO tracking, 3) Create an Employee Recognition Portal. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learning Flask, Ansible, SignalFx, Bootstrap, Celery, AWS-SAM \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : No Research Paper and patents were made or referred as it was \nsoftware development work. \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  work \nenvironment of the company is amazing. The people are really helpful and sincere in their work. \nThey listen to your doubts however silly they might be and try to solve them and all of them are \napproachable. There are regular knowledge transfer sessions which helps in listening to others’ \nwork  and  what  problem  they  are  facing  and  how  they  solved  it  this  leads  to  recognising  the \nproblem if faced by you in the future and then you can solve it yourself only. \nThe  company  is  a  start-up  and  this  is  the  main  reason  why  the  place  is  so  amazing.  The \nbusiness is doing well and thus is attracting new talents from top institutions and have a healthy \nenvironment. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Cloud Computing, Computer Networking"

In  my  first  project,  I  was  in  a  team  and  our  objective  was  to \nautomatically verify the personal information given by the supplier and customer is right or not. \nFor this, we had to make an API to call the government website and take information from there. \nTo  do  so  we  had  to  bypass  a  captcha.  To  break  the  captcha  we  made  a  machine  learning \nmodel to do so. \nThe second one was to make a part of a web application to automatically make a graph of the \ncompany’s transaction to map the connectivity between  companies.  Since  oxyzo(a  subsidiary \ncompany  of  OfBusiness)  is  an  SME  financing  platform.  So,  to  give  loans  to  a  company  our \nprocessing team has to run a background check on the bank transaction of the company. This is \na tedious process and requires a lot of time. So, to move this faster my project was to make this \ngraph of the companies that are our customer or have a history of a certain type from that bank \ntransactions. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w) : Spring  Mvc,  java,  neo4j,  react,  echarts,  python, \nkeras \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : To make  a  network of  companies to to make  the  loan processing \neasier \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : There were a lot of things that I learnt from working in OfBusiness. \nIt  includes  software  development,  how  to  work in  a  team,  how  to  manage  my  time  in  a  better \nway and lot other little things. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  working \nenvironment  of  the  company  was  very  friendly  and  supportive.

I was given a good project despite \nhaving virtually no experience in the field. And was helped whenever I needed it. My expectation \nfrom the company was to give a good project for me to learn the tricks and trade of the industry \nand  it  was  fulfilled.

Calculated  various  cost  metrics  related  to  the  entire \noperations  of  the  category.  After  about  a  month,  I  tracked  and  analysed  delivery  metrics  and \nworked  towards  optimizing  deliveries.  The  work  involved  finding  why  deliveries  are  not  getting \ndelivered and analysing that data through various cuts and angles : payment mode wise, region \nwise,  buyer  profile  wise,  delivery  time  wise  etc.  Later  on,  I shifted  to  a  new  team  as  Financial \nPlanning  and  Analysis  of  newly  launched  Fresh  category.  Here,  my  work  involved  building  all \ndata  related  processes  from  scratch  to  capture  and  analyse  a  variety  of  information.  This \nincludes,  inventory  management,  pricing,  returns,  delivery  statuses  etc.  Using  this  data,  I \nprepare monthly, quarterly  and  half  yearly  business  plans,  pricing  startegies,  sales forecasting \netc.  The  work  also  involves  meeting  buyers,  conducting  market  surveys,  understanding  buyer \nconcerns and recommending business actions to drive expansion. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : MS Excel, SQL. \n \nObjectives of the project : - Business Planning / Budgeting. - Tracking business plans against \nperformance. - Recommend business actions based on analytical findings. - Working with cross \n- functional teams to analyse processes and drive efficiency. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : - SQL.  \n- MS Excel \n- Startup world ; How it functions, how funding rounds really work, what is valuation,  \n- Business Knowledge ; Understanding buyer concerns, how to launch a category from scratch, \nhow various teams- ops, logistics, business development, product, tech come together to launch \nan ecommerce business \n- Finance  ;  How  to  make  financial  plans  for  a  business,  how  to  calculate  buy-sell  margins, \nproduct margins, stock reports. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \n\n447 \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nEnvironment  is  very  optimistic.

Since most people at Udaan are \nbuilding a business like this for the first time in their lives, questions, and sharing of knowledge \nis  highly  encouraged.    The  people  encourage  new  ideas  and  fully  support  you  to  get  them \nimplemented,  unless  there's  a  very  sound  reasoning  that  they're  too  dumb.  It's  a  very  healthy \nenvironment that way. The only expectation people have  is that you own your  work. If a job is \nassigned to you, make sure you do it as perfectly as possible, and update on whether there are \nerrors  or  whether  some  help  is  required  to  complete.  It's  either  do-it-or-inform-what's-the-\nblocker-so-i-can-help  kind  of  culture.

The solution \nwas  chosen  such  that  it  provided  the  most  efficient  sections  in  terms  of  stresses  at  ultimate \nstage  and  deflections  at  service  stage.  Any  typical  floor  was  divided  into  spans  of  11m  x  11m \nconsisting  of  primary  beams  and  secondary  beams  supported  on columns  at the  corners. The \nsection  of  primary  and  secondary  beams  were  designed  as  per  ArcelorMittal  ABC  Software \npackage  considering  the  composite  action  of  slab,  ensured  by  providing  one  row  of  shear \nconnectors welded to the beams. Connections were designed using OSDAG software package. \nFor  achieving  efficiency  and  economy  the  column  section  was  varied  along  the  height  of  the \nbuilding  by  decreasing the  thickness  of the  plate,  along  the  height  of  the  building. To  simulate \nthe structure so as to get accurate behavior, the structure was modelled as a three dimensional \nsteel-concrete  composite  ordinary  moment-resisting  frame  with  RCC  ductile  Shear  walls  in \nETABS:  2016  and  structural  performance  report  was  prepared.  Finally  bill  of  quantities  for  a \ntypical 11m x 11m bay was prepared. \n \n\n457 \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w) : ArcelorMittal  Beams  calculator,    ETABS,  \nSTAAD.pro, OSDAG \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : To  prepare  a  design  basis  report  for  designing  the  structural \nelements  of  a  steel-concrete  composite  multi-storeyed  commercial  structure.  To  review  the \nproposed design by preparing a structural performance report. To prepare the bill of quantities \nfor a typical 11m x11m bay. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The program introduced me to the newly emerging field of “Steel-\nConcrete Composite Structures\". Enhanced my skills of modelling, analyzing and designing an \nefficient  and  optimized  engineering  structure.  Exposed  me  to  current  practices  followed  in  a \ndesign  office  like  performing  quick  and  accurate hand  calculations,  effectively  using  the \nstandard  empirical  charts,  coefficients,  spread  sheets  and  various  national  and  international \nstandards.  Opportunity  to  get  hands  on  experience  of  FEM    based    commercial    software  \npackages    like    ETABS,  STAAD.Pro, ArcelorMittal    Beams    Calculator  (ABC),  OSDAG  etc.  by \nworking on real world problem. Eventually leading to acquire  the required competency in writing \na DBR (design  basis report), performing design calculations, and reviewing the design through \na SPR (structural performance report). \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : N.A. \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : VMS  is  a \nsmall  firm  in  terms  of  employee  numbers  but  large  in  terms  of  excelling  in  fundamentals  of \nstructural engineering bringing with it more than 60 years of experience in structural design. It is \none of the few firms having representation in BIS code committees. The firm is a perfect place \nfor freshers as it allows them to work on real world problems from day 1.

Sometimes  we  add \nsuch functionalities to SDK which can only be validated by user. So we need changes in app UI \nto  show  results  to  the  user  so that  they  can  verify  them.  If  you  don't  have  a  scalable  UI,  ui \nchange  would  take  a  lot  of  development  time  as  well  as  effort.
