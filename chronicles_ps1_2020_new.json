Field images from ESA's Sentinel 2-B \nsatellite  were  for  this  project.  The  very  large  images  were  broken  down  into  grids  and \nthe vegetative index was found to make boundaries visible.  The boundaries were hand-\ndrawn to make masks which would then be fed to the ML model. Any ML model could \nbe chosen and we decided upon the UNet Model. \nI  had  changed my  project  mid-way  as  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  ML  knowledge  required \nfor this. My new project was Enhanced Image Steganography. In this, messages have \nto embed into any image in a lossless format such as png with no noticeable alteration. \nWe did this by altering the LSB of RGB values of each pixel in an image using python to \nembed  the  message  which  had  been  converted  to  binary.  Later  the  message  can  be \ndecoded  using  another  python  script  where  the  process  is  reversed  to  recover  the \nmessage  hidden  in  the  image.  Upon  submitting  this,  various  methods  to  improve  this \nprocess using advanced encryption techniques was researched upon.  \nWhile doing the above, various group discussions were also held on current affair topics \nwhile  quizzes  where  conducted  upon  material  given  by  our  BITS  mentor,  which  in  my \ncase was on entrepreneurship. In the end, we had to present our program and submit a \nreport on it. \n\n32 \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The remote  PS  experience  can  be  described  as  self-study  with \nguidance.  The  project  requirements  and  general  direction  to  be  taken  is  given  by  the \nmentors  while  the  technical  requirements  for  implementation  must  be  acquired  on  our \nown  giving  a  feeling  of  freelancing.  The  group  discussions  and  presentation  give  a \nunique experience where you have to talk and show a presentation while not being able \nto  see  anyone's  expression.  Splitting  of  work  among  members  can  be  challenging  at \nfirst but once everyone achieves the same pace, it proceeds smoothly. Dedicating time \nto  sit  in  a  place  and  work  while  being  at  home  was  also  a  challenge  in  the  beginning \nand  I  had  to  learn  to  build  up  my  mental  strength  to  overcome  laziness  and  boredom \ndue to sitting in front of a screen for long hours. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : In  the  technical  aspect,  I  learnt  python  programming,  basics  of \nML,  image  processing  and  scrapping  all from  scratch. The  basics  of  cryptography  and \nsteganography was explained by my mentor through various research papers. \nIn  the  soft  skills  aspect,  learning  to  search  for  and  read  research  papers,  presenting \nyour model remotely, writing a formal project report, writing formal emails requesting for \nassistance,  team  work  and  coordination  among  various  members,  learning to  settle \ndisputes over the project and learning to speak remotely over a microphone are the my \nmain learning outcome out of this PS. \n \n \n------------"

There  were  hardly  any  difficulties  even \nthough we were working from our home. The group members were quite supportive of \neach other and I enjoyed a lot while working on the project. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  mainly  learned  web  development  which  is  not  a  part  of  our \ncourse until now. The languages and software used were new to me at first. Now I have \na good grasp on these topics. \nI learnt skills such as time management, coordination as a group which i am sure will be \nquite handy in the long run during my professional career. \n \n \n------------"

To  accomplish,  we  divided  our  team  into  two \nfor focusing on the Frontend and Backend Parts of the website. We used HTML, CSS, \nBootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend and NodeJS and Express for the backend. A \nlot  of  Node  packages  like  PassportJS,  Bcrypt,  nodemon,  dotenv  etc  was  also  used \nwhile developing the frontend. The Frontend was fairly easy to create. The difficult part \nwas  the  backend  when  we  were  dealing  with  encryption,  privacy  and  authorization. \nAnother point of debate was whether to store the files in a File System or a Database. \nWe  also  had  minor  discussions  on  SQL  vs  No-SQL  Databases  and  in  the  end,  we \nchose   MySQL   as   our   Database   for   the   stack.

In short this project summarizes how \nexactly the Internet of Things can accomplish this dream of humans. The project was to \nmonitor  the  real  time  temperature  and  humidity  of  a  room  which  can  be  remotely \nlocated,  on  our  own  web  site.  The  purpose  was  served  by  using  a  temperature  and  a \nhumidity sensor which are electronic devices capable of sensing temperature and water \nvapour  content  from  the  surrounding  air  and  responding  by  providing  output  analog \nsignals  generated  due  to  varying  output  voltages  based  on  the  changes  in  the \nsurrounding  parameters.  The  sensors  were  connected  to  an  external  hardware  known \nas  an  IoT  board  having  the  capability  to  connect  to  a  network  and  a  programming \ndevice  using  wireless  or  wired  connectivity.  I  used  the  most  popular  microcontroller \nbased board i.e. Node-MCU or ESP8266. The rest of the project dealt with the use of a \nnetwork  such  as  an  Internet  or  an  intranet  where  this  IoT  device  was  made  a  client \nsimply using libraries included in the Arduino IDE software. The client was then allowed \nto  request  the  database  such  as  the  Google  Firebase,  to  store  this  real  time  sensor \n\n52 \n \nreadings. The web browser client then simply requests this data from the IoT cloud and \ndisplays it. The same client-server communication was used to make an android app for \ndisplaying the same real time readings. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  was  all  together  fascinating  and  the  challenges  we \nfaced  due  to  the  covid-19  situation  added  up  to  the  learning  experience.

Object  detection  is  a \ncomputer-vision  task involving  detecting  instances  of  objects  of  a  certain  class(e.g. \nhumans, cars, etc.) from images or videos. Jetson Nano is a small, powerful computer \nmanufactured by NVIDIA and is used for embedded applications. The project aimed to \nhave vehicle detection work at 20+ FPS on Jetson Nano. Due to the memory and speed \nconstraints,  we  couldn't  choose  the  state of  the  art object  detection  models  like  YOLO \nv4, Faster RCNN. Instead, we chose the models SSD Mobilenet v2 and Tiny YOLO v3 \nwhich  could  work  in  the  constrained  environment  of  Jetson  Nano.  This  project  was \nassigned  to  1  other  student,  so  we  each  chose  a  model  to  work  with.  First,  we \npreprocessed the dataset which included cleaning, splitting and creating records. Then, \nwe  custom  trained  our  models  on  this  dataset.  Following  this,  we  tested  the  model  on \ntest images and evaluated the accuracy. Then we created an end to end ML pipeline for \n\n62 \n \ndetection  of  cars  in  videos  and  live  video  feed from a  webcam.  After  this,  we  installed \nthe required libraries, set up the environment and deployed both the models on Jetson \nNano.  Finally,  I  optimized  the  existing  SSD  model  with  TensorRT  and  multithreading \nwhich  gave  an  inference  speed  of  31  FPS  on  Jetson  Nano.  Additionally, we  also \ncreated a Flask API to deploy the working model on a local server. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  was  awesome.  To  start  with,  we  were  allowed  to \nchoose from 6 projects and there were 5 of us. All the projects were great. The projects \nwere related to HPC and ML. We started working from the first week itself. My mentor \nwas very helpful and gave us ample time to work on each aspect of the project. Due to \nthe  remote mode  of  operation,  we  had meetings  with  him  twice  a week  and  we  asked \ndoubts and discussed any problems on WhatsApp. He was always ready to help us and \nmade  sure that  we  were  working  ahead  of the  decided  timeline  of  the project. Our  PS \ninstructor was great too, he kept weekly meetings to get updates from us and organized \nthe  evaluative  components  very  well.    I  couldn't  have  wished  for  any  better  working \nenvironment than this for PS-I. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  learnt  the  basics  of  deep  learning  and  convolutional  neural \nnetworks. I am now able to work with the basic libraries in Python like NumPy, OpenCV, \nMatplotlib, seaborn and frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, Tensorboard, Darknet used \nfor deep learning. I learnt about the various object detection algorithms like YOLO, SSD \nand  got  to  explore  a  lot  of  different  versions  and  pre-trained  models of  these  two \nalgorithms. I got to work on NVIDIA's Jetson Nano and understood its advantages and \nlimitations.  I  understood  the  different  optimization  techniques  using  TensorRT  to \nimprove the performance of a model. I also learnt to create basic web APIs using Flask. \n \n \n------------"

Elixar Systems is a BITSian start-up working in the field of \nAugemented  Reality  (AR)  to  improve  education  in  India  and  abroad.  The  platform  I \nhelped create  from  scratch  is  called  'Aerth',  and  it  can  be  briefly  described  as  a \nproprietary  GitHub  for  AR  Development.  I  worked  mainly  on  the  backend  part  of  the \nplatform. \nThe Aerth platform is a place for all the AR developers associated with Elixar Systems \nto find and apply to new projects and work on them. They can upload all kind of files for \ntheir projects, receive stipend, find existing code, and interact with other developers and \nadministrators at Elixar Systems. Meanwhile, the admins at Elixar Systems get a place \nwhere they can manage all their projects and developers together and in an organized \nand seamless manner. \nI  used  Django  to  build  the  backend  of the  website and a  MySQL  database to  store  all \nthe data.

Since \nthe consignment moves through a number of hands, it is generally impossible to figure \nout  the  entity  responsible  for  the  damage  and  hence  insurance  isn't  assured.  Using \nblockchain  ensured  the  immutability  of  data  hence  preventing  any  tampering  of  the \nsame. It made sure various parties involved in the shipment process have a consensus \nby  the  signing  of  a  Smart  Contract  that  uses  blockchain.  Moreover,  since  high-value \nconsignments may have a number of physical requirements like proper temperature and \nhumidity, we used IoT technology to allow sensors to measure a threshold of values. To \nimplement  this,  we  developed  a  web  application  for  creating  and  tracking  shipments \nalong  with  passing  on  handover  requests  using  MERN  stack  for  the  web  development \nand AWS for its Blockchain and IoT services.

The project was \nquite  interesting  as  we  realized  that a  large number of  shipping  companies  incur  huge \nlosses  every  year  due  to tampering  and  damage  to high-value  consignments, and  it  is \ngenerally impossible to figure out the entity responsible for the damage. We devised the \nuse  cases  for  the  problem  and  determined  the  parties  that  will  be  participating  in  the \nshipment  process  like  the  consignment  receiver  and  shipper,  logistics and  insurance \nprovider,  vehicle  operator  and  so  on.  Then,  we  developed  a  user  interface  that \nfacilitates a smooth user experience. After a successful integration of the front-end and \nback-end modules, we progressed towards the final stage of the project, i.e., simulating \nthe IoT devices and integrating the Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the system. We \nused the AWS IoT and AWS Lambda for the simulation process. AWS Lambda helped \nus  to  elastically  generate  device  sensors  that  report  their  state  tot  he  AWS  cloud.  To \nstore the IoT readings from the sensor, we used Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. \nFurther, Amazon Managed Blockchain was an important component of our project as it \nmade  our  work  easier  to  create  and  manage  a  scalable  blockchain  network  using  the \npopular  open  source  frameworks  Hyperledger  Fabric  and  Ethereum.  Finally,  we  were \nable to come up with a solution to the frequently-faced problem in the shipping industry. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Due to the online mode of training, many of us were skeptical about \nthe efficiency of the system. But for me, it worked very well. PS-1 was well organized by \nthe institute and provided us with a great industrial experience. I believe that working on \na project at Happiest Minds was a great opportunity for me to make a good start in the \nindustrial  project  experience.  The  projects  at  Happiest  Minds  were  very  interesting  to \nwork  on  as  they  leverage  a  spectrum  of  technologies  like  CoE  Analytics,  IoT,  AI  & \nCognitive Computing, Blockchain, etc. \nAlong  with  the  interesting  projects provided by  Happiest  Minds, I believe  that  having  a \ngreat  learning  experience  at  Happiest  Minds  could not have  been possible  without  the \ncombined  effort  by  the  team  and  most  importantly,  the  mentors  who  supported  and \nencouraged  us  at  every  point  through  this industrial  project.  Despite  being  busy  with \ntheir  own  responsibilities  and  other  projects  at  Happiest  Minds,  they  managed  to  take \nout  time  to  help  and  guide  us  by  providing  their  valuable  inputs.  As  far  as  team \nmembers  are  concerned,  all  have  been  very  cooperative  with  each  other.  All my  team \nmembers  were  reliable,  trustworthy,  and  consistent  in  their  approach,  which  led  to  the \nteam to progress in the right direction.  \nI  truly  appreciate  the  efforts  taken  by  everybody,  including  my  PS  instructor  who  was \nthere  to  help  at  every  point  where  I  was  stuck.  She  coordinated  really  well  with  the \ncompany  professionals  and  mentors  to  make  the  hands-on  experience  of  working  on \nthe industrial project a fruitful one. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : Being a second-year dual-degree student, I had a little experience \nin programming at the time of the PS project. The most important learning outcome from \n\n103 \n \nthe PS-1  experience for  me  is that  you  can implement anything  you  wish  by  putting  in \nconstant  efforts.  The  technologies  that  we  used  in the  project  were  completely  new  to \nme,  but  the  approach  that  I  had  to  deal  with  the  problems  to  complete  the  assigned \ntasks helped me to become a better learner. \nThe second learning outcome which I believe is very valuable to me is the inspiration I \ntook  from  the  mentors  at  Happiest  Minds.  Their  way  to  approach  problems  and \nmanaging  the  team  was  something  that  I  want  to  inculcate  in  my  attitude.  They  have \nmade me learn to incorporate different aspects of a problem and to constantly work on \nthe optimization part of the developed project. \n \n \n------------"

Day-to-day \nassignments were given based on the topics taught and we were supposed to present it \nto everyone on the very next day. I had some prior knowledge in this area so found the \ntasks  pretty  simple  but  it  will  take  really  good  efforts    if  you  are  new  to  this  as  they \nexpect  us  to  grasp  the  key  concepts  very  quickly  and  bring  it  to  application  as  well. \nFrom the second week onwards, we were introduced to git and the basic commands for \npushing and pulling code from remote repositories as we were expected to collaborate \nand work on the project as a team. As the product's requirement for the frontend User \nInterface was Angular framework, we were introduced to Typescript and then went on to \nbuild small applications in Angular. The training phase was pretty good where we were \ntaught the basics as well as some intermediate concepts in Angular and that helped us \nin the project phase. In the third week we were split into teams of 4 and each team was \nassigned  a  problem  statement  along  with  a  mentor  to  guide  them  if  they  face  any \ndifficulty related to the tasks. We had to give updates about our everyday contributions \nto  the  project to  our  mentor  in  the evening  and  a final  demo of  the  problem  statement \nwas  given to the director of the company where he suggested the changes that should \n\n108 \n \nbe  made  in  the  UI  screens.  After  the  demo  we  were  given  some  time  to  rectify  the \nissues  and  were  asked  to  submit  a  documentation  of  the  problem  statement.  With  a \nsecond problem statement being more challenging compared to to the first one,  I really \ngot  to  learn  a  lot  from  other  members  of  my  team.  At  the  start  things  seemed  to  be \nconfusing  but  slowly  we  got  accquainted  with  the  process  and made  significant \ncontributions to the project. Overall it was a very enriching experience for me as it gave \nconfidence to work on further projects in this domain. It took a lot of effort to complete \nthe  project  and  meet  the  deadlines  but  ultimately  it  gave me  a  glimpse  of  how \nproduction level code is written ,maintained and further developed. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : Learnt  frontend  web  development  using  Angular  framework  and \nintegrating  with  google  graphs.  Working  with  git  and  bitbucket  as  version  control \nsystems for the source code of the project \n \n \n------------"

The  COOOL  STEM  Games  or  the  MetaStudio  platform  is  a \nCollaborative  Open  Online  and  Ongoing  Learning  discussion  forum  which  enables \nproject-based    learning    to    encourage    Science,    Technology,    Engineering    and \nMathematics (STEM) education and to inculcate STEM habits in people.  \nThe  idea  was  to  build  a  responsive  and  progressive  web  app  that  is  functionally  the \nsame to the MetaStudio platform while at the same time being parsimonious in resource \n(network  and  storage)  usage.  The  project  aims  to  expand  the  horizons  of  STEM \nlearning by making it accessible to people with very slow internet connectivity in a vast \ncountry like India.  \nThe project domain was web development with a 'mobile first' approach. I had to work in \nareas  like  frontend  (HTML,  CSS,  JavaScript),  backend  (Node.js  and Express.js), \ntemplating with EJS, required an understanding of privacy, cookies, sessions, hashing, \nnetworks  and  various protocols  used  to  communicate  and  the  way  data  is  sent  across \nnetworks  as  XML  or  JSON,  understanding  API  documentation and  sometimes  reverse \nengineering it through network logs of MetaStudio website and using service worker to \ndeliver pages offline by caching them. \nOur team succeeded in making the desired app with 98% less resource usage and 50% \nfaster loading speed. At the end of six weeks, we were able to launch the app for public \nbeta testing. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: PS1  has  provided  me  with  the  opportunity  to  work  at  a  premier \nresearch  institute  HBCSE,  Mumbai.  This  allowed  me  to  interact  with  experienced  and \nknowledgeable mentors while collaborating with talented peers. The mentors were very \nfriendly and cordial, they rather wanted us to call them by their name and drop 'sir' The \nwork  environment  was  amazing  with  flexible  timings  and  no  hard  and  strict  deadlines. \nOur  team  was  allowed  to  make  the  web  app  the  way  we  wanted  with  minimal \nintervention  from  the  mentors.  They  guided  us  when  we  got  stuck  while  using  the \nextensive API.  \nThe PS not only allowed me to gain exciting technical skills but we were able to gain a \nlot  of  soft  skills  as  well.  I  got  introduced  to  the  systematic  process  of  Software \ndevelopment through an exciting and vast world of Web Development. We understood \nhow client needs are taken into account while building a software and how to adapt to \nnew  changes  in  the  client  needs based  on  its  feasibility.  Collaboration  is  the  key  to \nSoftware development process. This was learnt and used extensively by doing version \ncontrol by using Git on GitHub. Reading technical pages like documentation is important \nto  build  a  great  software  using  pre  built  APIs.  Understanding  the formalities  needed  to \nbuild  a  README  and  making  an  effective  documentation  of  my  own  work  is  essential \nand  was  learnt  through  PS1.  Testing  and  debugging  using  tools  and  test  cases  is  a \nsalient and underlying feature of all software and was included in this project too. PS1 \ntaught  us  the  art  of  addressing  client  needs,  managing  time  and  setting  achievable \ntargets.  Presenting  updates  and  reporting  for  meetings  helped  us  gain  important  soft \nskills which are needed to work in any domain in life. \n\n118 \n \nThe   evaluations   were   well   planned   and   strikingly   different   from   routine   course \nevaluations  as  they  not  only  focused  on  the  technical  aspect,  but  also  at  holistic \ndevelopment.  \nAt  the  end  of  six  weeks,  the  surprise  public  beta  testing  release  of  our  app  at  the \nvaledictory  function  made  us  very  happy  and  the  efforts  we  put  in  the  last  six  weeks \nseemed to be redeemed in the best possible way. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  have  gained  new  technical  knowledge  and  skills.  I  got  to  learn \nand  work  in the  domain  of  Web  Development  and  dived  deep  into  areas  like  frontend \n(HTML,  CSS,  JavaScript),  backend  (Node.js  and  Express.js),  templating  with  EJS, \nprivacy,   cookies,   sessions,  hashing,   networks,   understanding  API  documentation, \nsending JSON data, working with JSON Web Tokens and OAuth2 authentication. I got \ninsight into professional practices like working and collaborating in teams on GitHub. \nPS1  also  taught  us  the  art  of  addressing  client  needs,  managing  time  and  setting \nachievable   targets.   Updating   with weekly   plans,   presentations   and   reporting   for \nmeetings helped me gain important soft skills essential for working in any domain in life.   \nThe  real-life  problem  statement  of  making  a  STEM  discussion  forum  lighter  so  that  it \ncan  give  great  user  experience to  people  with  low  network  speeds  like  Jammu  and \nKashmir  made  me  realize  that  most  important    learning  was  understanding  the \nproblems society faces and finding solutions to make their life better. \n \n \n------------"

STEMGames  seeks  to  inculcate  \"STEMhabits\"  and  a \nlasting avidity for scientific knowledge while achieving meaningful creations made by the \nparticipants themselves. The idea \nwas to build a responsive and progressive web app that is functionally the same to the \nmetastudio  platform  while  at  the  same  time  being  parsimonious  in  resource  (network \nand  storage)  usage.  It  wishes  to  expand  the  horizons  of  STEM  learning  by  making  it \naccessible to people with very slow internet connectivity in a vast country like India. The \npreference  is  for  User  experience  (UX),  speed  and  ease  of  use,  or  the  ergonomic \ndesign instead of a cluttered, overburdened, and slow website. The aim was to generate \na  client  to  work  with  the  present  API  while  supporting  a  cross-platform  and  mobile-\nfriendly User Interface (UI). The website had to be built with a mobile-first approach. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: This  was  a  new  and  enriching  experience  for  me.  I  have  never \nworked in the field of web development before and there were a lot of new things I had \nto  learn  before  I  could  get  started  on  making  the  web  app  along  with  my  team.  For \ninstance,  I  have  never  worked  with  CSS  or  JavaScript  before.  I  might  also  add  that  it \nwas challenging at times, frustrating even. But therein lies the beauty that I have come \nto  associate  with  the  process  of  software  development.  It  has  its  ups  and  downs,  but \none has to learn to battle through it and push forward. Although it was a wfh PS, I was \nnot able to get any actual industry tour still the experience has been quite holistic. I have \nalso  learnt  a  great  deal  about  what  this  prestigious  institution  stands  for.  Science \nEducation.  I  am  glad  to  have  had  a  hand  in  bettering  the  process  and  in  doing  so, \nservice to society. \n \n\n120 \n \n \nLearning   Outcome : Learning   about   Web   Development   and   chronicling   and \ncollaborating on a project on Github. \n \n \n------------"

These models were used to classify \npixels into different landcover types, like forests, water, soil etc. \nWe  will  further  use  these  classified  images  for  change  detection,  ie.  automatically \ndetecting change in landcover.  \nWe have integrated all these functions in a GUI to make our program user-friendly. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  went  into  PS-I  expecting  to  do  work  only  related  to  Machine \nLearning/Deep  Learning.  Though  the  project  was  related  to  these,  it  turns  out  that  all \nthese  ML  models  are  already  implemented  and  we  just  have  to  use  them.  Our  main \nwork  was  getting  to know  about  Google  Earth  Engine,  and  learning  how  to  fetch  and \nvisualize  data.  Further,  we  learnt  how  to  use  the  already  implemented  models,  also \nimplementing SAM classification from scratch. \nIn short, our work didn't use any of our knowledge of ML/DL. Instead, a majority of our \ntime was spent in image visualization and making the GUI. It also seemed as if we were \ndoing software development, not remote sensing,  which  was  very different than what I \nhad expected. \n \n\n132 \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt a lot about remote sensing as a field. I learnt how to use \nGoogle Earth Engine, and have started to appreciate the platform which makes remote \nsensing  a  lot  easier.  I  have  learnt  that  a  lot  of  work  related  to  ML/DL  doesn't  involve \nbuilding  models  from  scratch,  but  is  more concerned  about  how  to  fine-tune  these \nmodels according to your needs, and also to integrate them in your application.  \nI learnt a bit about how industry-grade code should look like. When multiple people are \nworking on a project, the code should be properly commented and documented so that \nanyone can understand it. \n \n \n------------"

The first stage was to compare \nthe  heights  of  two  clouds  from  their  IR  image.  So  I  applied  the  threshold  function  of \nOpenCV here which separated clouds with a low height from clouds with high height. I \nused  concepts  of  Stefan-Boltzmann  law  and  Lapse  rate  in  this  separation.  I  also  tried \nTherimage  packages  from  R  language  of  separation  which  helped  in  separation  by \nplotting images with different palettes. After this, we needed to automate our model and \nalso find the absolute value of the height of the cloud. For automation, a cloud detector \nwas  needed.  I  used  contour  plotting  of  OpenCV  which  detect  clouds  using  edge \ndetection and plots a rectangle around it which it cropped later. Now we need to find the \naverage  temperature  of  the  cloud  detected  from  the  contour.  For  this  first,  I  stored  all \npixel  values  with  its  temperature  in  dictionary  extracted  from  the  color  bar  of  the  IR \nimage. Then I moved to every pixel of the cropped out image of the cloud and searched \nfor its corresponding temperature in the dictionary and took the average temperature of \nall the pixels of the cloud. And finally using dry lapse rate I calculated the height of the \ncloud.  This  method  of  cloud  height  detection  is  fast  and  cheap  as  compared  to  the \ncurrent method used by IMD in cloud height detection. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  got  to  learn  various  skills  due  to  PS1.  Our  instructor  helped  us  to \nlearn  all  the  skills  from  the  beginning  and  to  get  ideas  for  the  progress  of  our  project. \nOur instructor conducted daily meetings to solve our doubts and guide us for further on. \nOur Instructor regularly contacted IMD mentors to help us in our project and sharing our \n\n142 \n \nprogress. He  divided  us  into  a  group  of  2-4  students  based  on  our  streams.  Our \ninstructor  shared  many  tutorial  videos  and  text  so  as  to  introduce  us  to  various  topics \nwhich would be needed in our project. These tutorials were very nice and guided us to \nvarious  topics  which  could  be  further  explored  from  various  tutorials  available  on  the \ninternet.  Honestly,  at  the  beginning  of    PS1  I  was  having  zero  knowledge  about  these \nskills and topics but after completion of PS, I having good knowledge of these skills with \nexperience which I gained in doing these projects. \n \n \n \nLearning Outcome : In these 6 weeks of PS1, I gained various skills. My project in PS \n1 was based on calculating cloud height using image processing of IR images of clouds \nclicked  from  the  earth.  Before  starting  the  project,  some  prerequisites  were  needed  to \nbe completed so as to ensure a proper understanding of the project and generate ideas \nfor the project. The first and most important skill required to gain before the start of the \nproject  was  understanding image  processing  theory  and  various  tools  used  in  it.  After \nthis,  I  learned  Deep  Learning  (especially  Convolutional  Neural  Networks)  concepts \nwhich are also important for the automation of our project work. After the completion of \nall  the  theory  part  of  image  processing  and  deep  learning,  I  felt  a  great  need  for \napplying  these  concepts  practically.  So  I  worked  on  some  algorithms  of  Convolutional \nNeural   Networks   on   Google   Colab   notebook,   some   of   these   algorithms   include \n(handwritten  digits  detection  and  cat and  dog  detection).  And  for  Image  processing,  I \nchoose OpenCV libraries of Python. I worked on many image processing tools like Edge \ndetection, haar-cascade and contour plotting on OpenCV. I also tried the YOLO object \ndetection library and R-thermimage packages. \n \n \n------------"

We \ncoordinated with our mentors at NIC from time to time using Google Meet and updated \nthem about our progress. They guided us and sometimes suggested modifications. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : We learnt new languages like GoLang, JavaScript etc. and learnt \nhow the blockchain functions. Furthermore, we extensively studied Hyperledger Fabric, \nupon which our project network  was deployed. We made a front-end for the student & \nthe  Admin,  a  blockchain  back-end  and  an  API  to  connect  the  two.  At  every  stage  the \nwork  was  divided  among  teammates.  Our  instructor  took  seminars  and  we  also \nparticipated in a group discussion. \n \n \n------------"

There  are  a  number  of  things  that  are \ninvolved in doing a market study. So we did Qualitative analysis as well as Quantitative \nanalysis.Under Qualitative analysis we took the competitors of PayPal and found out as \nto what all services are offered by PayPal and others, which all are the areas that need \nto be improved upon.On similar lines, Qualitative analysis was further done using three \nbenchmark  techniques  namely  SWOT  analysis,  PEST  analysis,  Porter's  Five  Forces \nanalysis  of  the  digital  wallet  industry  in  India.Quantitative  analysis  was  done  studying \nthe behavior of the consumer under two categories - those using PayPal and those who \nuse some other mode.The variables included frequency of purchases, amount, etc. We \nalso made a web-page where different graphs could be found as soon as we input the \ndata of PayPal or other competitors with and without time being taken as a frame. This \nwas  done  for  a  better  Quantitative  analysis  that  could  also  compare  PayPal  with  its \ncompetitors.

Before,  the  NGO  worked  using \nWhatsapp and word-of mouth.  \nWe used Zoho Creator (a low code platform for creating custom applications) to create \nan application  which  contained  forms  to  collect  data  like  donor  form,  beneficiary  form, \nvolunteer  form,  and  donation  page.  We  also  created  a  public  Dashboard  to    show \nstatistics about the donations made till date. \nFor  better  reach  we  also  created  an android  application  (using  Java)  which  will  collect \ndata  from  donor/beneficiary/volunteer  and  send  it  to  the  Zoho  application  using  API \ncalls.  The  android  app  also  features  a  dashboard  which  shows  all  the  donation \nstatistics. \nWe have automated the application to a certain extent which are as follows. Whenever \ndetails  are  submitted,  an  email  is  sent  to  the  user  about  his/her  submission.  The \napplication  checks  for  mandatory  fields,  valid  mobile  number,  valid  Aadhaar  card \nnumber, etc. Whenever  a  beneficiary  sends  a  request for  help,  an  email  is  sent  to  the \nadmin for verification of the request. The request for help is automatically closed when \nthe target amount of monetary help is reached. \nThe process flow is as follows. The beneficiary submits the request for help. The admin \nmay  check  and  verify  the  request  and  may  confirm  the  request.  If  the  request  is \nconfirmed  a  new  campaign  is  created  and  mail  is  sent  to  all  donor  about  the  new \ncampaign.  Donations  are  accepted  till  the  target  amount  is  reached.

The  project  involved \nextraction  of  satellite  images  from  Google  Earth  Engine  platform  and  applying  image \npre-processing  techniques  using  Python  libraries  such  as  GeoPandas,  Supermercado, \nRiotiler and Solaris. The high resolution aerial images were obtained and were divided \ninto  smaller  tile  format  and  the  dataset  was  split  into  training  and  validation  set.  The \ntraining  set  consisted  of  the  raw  images  and  the  corresponding  labels  of  the  desired \nsegmentation  region.  Then,  the  prepared  dataset  was  used  to  train  the  appropriate \nneural network model and finally, the trained network was used to perform the semantic \nsegmentation on new images to detect solar farms, buildings and sand dunes. The best \nperforming  model  was  selected.  A  systematic  study  of  various  popular  semantic \nsegmentation architectures such as UNET and DeepLab V3+ was conducted in order to \n\n207 \n \nbetter understand their inner workings. The results were analyzed and the most suitable \nneural network model was chosen, which was DeepLab V3+ model. \n \n \nPS-I   experience: Overall,   PS-1   provided   a   good   experience.

Our mentor dr. Gaurav provided us with thekml file \nwhich contained labels of the marked solar farms.With the help of google earth engine \nwe had to extract the geotiff image of the labels and then make the dataset required for \ntraining step.Before this we were provided with some resources which contained  similar \nkind of approach for the building segmentation and it helped us a lot in our project.The \ntools used by us in project were google colab,GEE etc.The project was done in python \nand  various  different  such  as  solaris,riotiler,super  mercado  for  the  preprocessing \npart.The model which we used for semantic segmentation   was UNET.In post analysis \nwe came to know that since our dataset was small and UNET also was small model our \naccuracy  was  very  less.So  we  used  some  techniques  such  as  data  agumentation  and \nwe  changed  our  training  model  to  deepLabv3+  which  was  developed  by  google  for \nsemantic segmentation.

Surveillance  of  these  solar  farms \nwould  help  in  providing better  monitoring  and  optimal  utilization  of  renewable  energy \nsources. The detection of sand dunes in a particular area gives a rough idea about the \ndrought  conditions,  overgrazing,  unsustainable  agricultural  practices,  etc.  We  used \nSemantic  Segmentation, which  is  a  technique  to  classify  each  pixel  of  an  image  into \ndifferent  groups.  We  were  given  the  labeling  of  Solar  farms  and  Sand  dunes  in  a  kml \nfile. We imported and processed satellite images of the same via Google Earth Engine. \nThe entire project was done in three phases - Pre-processing, Main segmentation, and \nPost-processing. Pre-processing involved in breaking the GeoTIFF Satellite images into \nsmall  tiles.  These  tiles  were  fed  into  a  deep  learning  model.  We  used  two  different \narchitectures to compare and contrast our results - UNet and DeepLabV3. DeepLabV3 \nproved  to  be  a  more  effective  model  with  an  accuracy  of  almost  70%.

First  we  did  Literature \nReview on the subject by reading some research papers. Then we choose a face image \ndataset  and  did  Exploratory  Data  Analysis  on  it  to  know  the  dataset  better.  Then  we \ntried  to  preprocess  the  images  for  input  in  the  model.  Then,  we  built  3  Convolutional \nNeural  Networks  for  gender  classification,  age  group  classification  and  exact  age \nprediction and a baseline accuracy was reached. Then we kept on tweaking/optimizing \nthe  model  to  get  as  much  accuracy  as  possible.  After  that  we  also  tried  other  bigger \nface datasets.

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up  \n \nShort Summary of work done : We developed an everyday medication reminder app \nas our PS1 project. For developing the app, we learnt java and android studio. The app \n\n232 \n \nwas  designed  keeping  in  mind  the  fact  that  in  today's fast  paced  world,  people  often \nforget  important  things.  Some  of  them  might  have  medical  issues  like  diabetes, \nhypertension,   autoimmune   disorders   and   so   on,   which   require   constant   periodic \nmedication  to  survive.  But  unfortunately,  due  to  multiple  reasons, we  often  find  that \npeople  forget  to  take  their  medication  because  they  are  in  a  rush  or  because  they \nsimply  don't  remember  with  all  sorts  of  things  on  their  mind.  Our  simple  app  sends  a \nreminder  to  the  user  at  the  specified  time  to  take  their  medication.  Some  medications \nmight  need  to  be  taken  daily.  Some  might  need  to  be  taken  weekly.  Our  app  has \nrepetition interval provision for that as well. Once the user clicks on the notification, they \nwill be taken back to the app where they can enter the pills they have consumed. This \nwill be used to keep track of the total number of pills consumed during the month as a \nmeasure of their regularity. It also has a reset button to reset the count of pills. The user \ncan also delete old reminders once their prescriptions have been updated. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Working  with  Tamil  Nadu  Health  System  Reforms  was  a  fantastic \nexperience  which  provided  me  with  a  lot  of  knowledge  about  how  the  industry  works \nand  how  everything  is  set  up  in  a  professional  environment.  The  people working  at \nTamil  Nadu  Health  System  Reforms  clearly  specified  what  they  expected  of  us.  The \nguidance  of  our  PS1  faculty  was  also  invaluable.  We  were  able  to  structure  a \nmethodical  plan  to  complete  the  project  and  meet  our  goals  within  the  specified  time \nlimit.  Every  week,  we  implemented  a  new  functionality  in  the  app,  tested  it  and  then \nstarted  implementing  a  new  functionality  the  next  week.  In  this  manner,  what  initially \nseemed  like  a  daunting  task,  was  turned  into  much  smaller  volumes  which  we  could \nhandle.  Overall,  it  was  a  great  opportunity  and  the  industry  exposure  received  will  be \nuseful forever. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : In  the  course  of  our  project,  we  learnt  how  to  make  apps  in \nandroid studio from scratch. We learnt java for the purpose of android studio and all the \nassociated   functionalities   necessary   for   building   android   apps.   We   learnt   about \ndesigning  the  front  end  which  the  user  actually  interacts  with  and  how  to  start  a  new \nactivity  and  transition  smoothly  from  one  activity  into  another.  We  also  learnt  about \nstoring  data permanently  in  android  using  a database and  about using  alarms  to  send \nnotifications at the specified time. \n \n \n------------"

Based  on  the \nhistorical data provided, we had to predict the value of wind speed 15 days in advance. \nEmphasis  was  given  on  improving  the  prediction  performance  to  cope  with  the \nrequirements of the energy markets.  \nThe  major  challenge  was  the  dynamic  nature  of  wind.  We  had  to  perform  a  lot  of \nanalysis  into  the  dataset  to  identify  if  it  was  standardized,  and  if  there  was  any \nseasonality  or  trend  present  in  the  data.  It  was  a  new  experience to  work  with  such  a \nlarge dataset. We even had to use Spark for a few data handling operations. The whole \ncoding  aspect  of  the  project  was  in  Python  language.  We  used  Jupyter  notebook  and \nGoogle COLAB.  \nWe proceeded to decompose the data into linear and non-linear series and handle each \npart  separately.  For  the  linear  part,  we  used  the  rolling  ARIMA  model  for  time  series \nanalysis. The non-linear part was handled by training neural networks. We tried different \nArtificial  Neural  Networks  like  Deep  NN,  Recursive  NN,  LSTM(Long  Short  Term \nMemory). \nFinally  we  combined  the  predictions  using  their  residues  and  model  ensembling \ntechniques. \nIn  six  week's  time,  we  could  complete  the  end-goal  of  our  project  and  we  submitted  a \nmodel  that  gives  a  decent  accuracy  of  84%  in predicting  the  wind  speed  15  days  in \nadvance. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The technical skills that I have learnt during this internship have made \nme fall in love  with the idea of data-driven solutions. May it be time series models like \nARIMA or deep neural networks like LSTM, I have certainly improved my knowledge of \nmachine learning and that too by actually implementing all these on a practical level!  \nThe mentors were extremely helpful and were always ready to give their perspective on \nany  problems  faced.  We  were  even  supervised  by  the  top-tier  officials  from  the \ncompany,  and  their  motivation  really  helped  me  stay  dedicated  throughout.  The  best \npart  was  that  many  of  the  top-tier  officials  of  the  company  are  BITS  Pilani  Alumni,  so \nthey were all very friendly and expected a lot from us. \n\n238 \n \nThe  projects  offered  were  interesting,  the  data  provided  was  extensive,  and  we  were \nencouraged to think on our own and come up with our own solutions and approaches. I \nwould say that TIBIL offers a highly conducive environment for someone who wants to \nlearn  and  explore  more  in  the  fields  of  Data  Analytics,  Machine  Learning  and  Data \nEngineering. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : Frameworks/Languages:  Python,  Tensorflow,  Spark,  Keras, \nPandas, Matplotlib, Scipy \n1.  I  gained an exposure  to forecasting  principles  in  general.  Forecasting  is  a  vast field \nexpanding from weather prediction to the stock market trend predictions.  \n2.  I  learnt  how  different  time  series  analysis  techniques  like  ARIMA  models  work,  and \nalso  implemented  them  on  real-world  data.  ARIMA  models  can  be  found  in  the \nstatsmodels library. \n3. I also got a chance to study and implement several neural network models like DNN, \nRNN, LSTM. I made use of Tensorflow, Keras and Scikit-learn for the implementations. \n4.  I  further  went  on  to  learn  how  to  ensemble  models  to  create  the  most  robust \nprediction model. \n \n \n------------"

Since none of the students admitted to this technology were familiar with it, \nthe first half of PS-I saw us researching and understanding the theory that Blockchain is \nbased  on.  We  had  to  look  into  and  fully  understand  the  now  famous  2009  Bitcoin \nWhitepaper from Satoshi nakamoto, followed by the Ethereum Whitepaper from Vitalik \nButerin.  Along  with  this  ,  we  looked  into  many  new  (well,  they  were  new  to  us) \ninteresting   topics   in   the   fields   of   cryptography,   distributed networking   and   data \ncompression.  \nIn  the  second  half  of  PS-I,  we  used  a  DLT  (Distributed  Legder  Technology)  platform \nnamed Corda to design a solution for the supply chain industry. We had to learn a lot of \ntheory  that  made  made  Corda  different  form  regular  Blockchain  technology  and  also \n\n254 \n \nlearn how to write code using their libraries and tools to implement our solution. We had \nabout a week to make ourselves fluent in the Kotlin programming language because the \nCorda library is written in that language. \nIn the end, we were able to make a simple application in the form of a very basic supply \nchain management solution. \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS-I was a great experience overall.  \nI learnt a lot of things while working on our project, both in terms of soft skills as well as \ntechnical  skills.  When  it  comes  to  soft  skills,  my  teamwork  and  leadership  skills  were \nobviously  challenged.  For  one,  we  were  supposed  to  collaborate  with  students  from \nother campuses, who we had never met before. Getting to know them enough to work \neffectively  with  them  was  a  challenge  we  all  were  able  to  overcome.  We  learnt  each \nothers  coding  styles  and  how  each  of  us  thought  and  understood  different  things \ndifferently.  \nAs far as technical skills are concerned, everything that we did was new to us so almost \nall of the knowledge that we were able to soak in and retain is all really a technical skill \nboost.  We  learn  a  new  programming  language  and  learn  to  use  libraries  that  other \npeople had written just by inspecting their documentation. \nIn all that we did, we had full support from our faculty in charge as well as our mentor.. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : As  I've  said  before,  everything  that  we  were  able  to  do,  was  a \nmajor  learning  for  us.  Using  other  people's  open  source  libraries,  setting  up  project \nstructures the way they are set in a professional environment, a thorough understanding \nof blockchain as well  as a decent understanding of all the mathematical and computer \nscience related concepts involved in this field were all major learning outcomes.

Proper  analysis  and \nunderstanding of data allows individuals and companies to make meaningful decisions \nin  their  workflow.  When  an  organisation  hires  a  student  for  employment,  it  takes  into \n\n274 \n \nconsideration  the  various  curricular  and  non-curricular  activities  of  the  student,  so  that \nthe student with the perfect fit for the job profile is hired. \nOur responsibility was to build a data analytics tool, which would take a certain number \nof  parameters(the  parameters  being  the  academic  and  non-academic  activities  of  the \nstudent),  and  predicts  the  probability  of  him/her  getting  hired  by  a particular  firm.

We built  our  own  data  (it  was  not  given  to \n\n276 \n \nus) by having student data that have sat for placements and were recruited or not. Our \nprediction parameter was whether the student should be recruited or not. \nTo store the data, we used a MySql database, from where the data was called using a \nPython  script  and  then  loaded  into  a  pandas  dataframe.  To  segregate  the  student  on \nparameters like CGPA, Work experience, etc, we had an interactive feature where the \nuser can  not  only  define  the  values  on  which  the  students  are  sorted,  but  also  can \nchoose the parameters itself on which the students are being sorted. Then the final data \nwas pushed back into the database for the rest of the tools to use.  \nThe cleaned data was used for building dashboards in Tableau to identify the relevant \nparameters. Each parameter was compared with the recruitment status to identify which \nparameter  actually  governs  whether  the  student  is  suitable  or  not.  These  charts  were \ndynamically changing whenever any parameter was changed. We also carried out PCA \nanalysis and a basic decision tree model in Tableau for the same.  \nWe  then  tried  5  classification  techniques  for  our  ML  model  and  identified  the  best \nperforming  one.  To  tackle  the  problem  of  which  student  has  priority  over  which  in  the \nrecruitment process, we built a regression model to assign a \"score\" (based on the most \ncorrelated  parameters)  to  generate  a  ranking  system.  Finally  using  TabPy  library,  we \nmanaged  to  run  our  Python  script  in  the  back-end,  and  link  it  into  an  interactive \ndashboard.  We  built  two,  one  where  the  dataset  can  be  used  and  the  other  where \nvalues could be manually entered to get a result. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was a wonderful experience for me. I and one other student in my \ngroup  had  taken  the  initiative  of  being  the  group  representative.  This  was  my  first \nproject  where  I  was  leading  the  group. The only  bad  thing  was  that  there  were  almost \nnext  to  no  interactions  from  Wipro's  side.  All  interactions  happened  through  our  PS \ninstructor. It was only because he was so energetic that all our queries were resolved. \nOur PS started almost a week late because there was no communication from Wipro's \nside.  Also,  our  industry  mentor  was  assigned  to  us  after  the  midterm  report  was \nsubmitted. Both mentors were incredibly helpful after being assigned to us and gave us \ngood  advice  regarding  our  project.  If Wipro was  as  invested  in  this  project  as us,  then \nthis would have been an ideal real-world industry project. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  was  never  that  interested  in  Data  analytics,  but  I  learnt  a  lot \nabout it. I learnt about taking timely decisions, and some soft skills. If Wipro would have \nguided us more, then maybe I would have learnt a lot more. We had to find most of the \nmaterials  and  work  around  every  detail  by  ourselves.  Had  these  been  resolved  by  our \nindustry mentor in time, then maybe the project, as well as our individual learning, would \nhave gone way further than expected. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n277"

The project was devised \nkeeping in mind the accessibility of smartphones to the people of the village, Pilani and \nthe current situation of this epidemic, COVID-19. The low energy wearable device will be \nuseful for the people who do not carry smartphones while the app is for the people who \ncarry  smartphones.  The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to help maintain ‘social distancing’ \namongst  the  visitors  of  the  Museum  or  any  other  place  with  a  sizable  footfall.  This  is \nensured by creating a device and an app which triggers an alarm when a visitor is close \nto  another  by  a  distance  of  3  feet  and  less.  For  the  device  to  be  energy  efficient,  the \ntechnology we could think of was Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). I have used Arduino IDE \nto develop the code which I want to load onto the microcontroller, ESP32, so that it works \naccording  to  the  requirements  for  this project.  We  initialise  names  of  the  low  energy \nwearable device and advertise its name, so that when scanned, it displays the names of \nthe  Low  energy wearable  devices  along  with  other  BLE  devices.  While  initialising  the \nnames of the devices, I had ensured to give the same name (let’s say ‘Device’) to all the \nwearable  low  energy  devices.  Scan  for  all  devices  and  then  filter  for  those  devices \n(Smartphones and the LE Smart device) which have the name ‘Device’ (as mentioned). \nFor those devices, we get the RSSI values and TX power, from which we can calculate \nthe distance between any two BLE devices using a formula. So, when the name of device \nscanned, is ‘Device’ and the distance between the two devices is less than 3 feet, then \nan alert would be generated by vibrating the vibration motors and making the LEDs glow. \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-1 station  at  Birla  Science  Center  has provided me  with good \nopportunity and has guided us on how to pursue the project and had also helped us in \ntimes when needed help regarding the project.

The App \nhad two entry points: 1. Login as an employee and login as HR / manager. Employee was \n\n26 \n \nasked to fill an employee form where he / she was asked some basic details and then the \ndata given by the employee was stored in our database. HR / manager of the company \ncould see the data of employees of his company and then he was provided with an option \nto  ask  the  employee  to  either  work  from  home  or  work  from  office and  then  this  work \nstatus was directed to the employees as a notification. Also, employee would receive a \nnotification to update necessary fields on daily basis such as his body temperature and \nhas he / she visited a containment or red zone, etc. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Our  PS-1 was  conducted  in  a  remote mode due  to  global  pandemic \ncrisis.  I  had  a  decent  CG  to  choose  between  a  government  institute,  start-up  and  a \nreputed company. However, personally I preferred CEERI because I have heard positive \nreviews  on  it through  seniors  and  they  also  mentioned  that  in  CEERI  work  is  properly \ncoordinated  by  faculty  and  mentors  which  indeed  came  to  be  true.  My  experience  at \nCEERI was amazing. There was a lot to learn about the research carried by the scientists \nthere. Also, the faculty and mentor really motivated us in  pursuing the project. Also, prior \nto project selection we were properly guided about the project. This really helped a lot in \nchoosing a project. \n \n \nLearning outcome: During PS-1, it was for the first time that I had been working on a \ngroup project.

Then, in a week or \ntwo, we got accustomed with it. Another learning outcome which I feel is important is soft \nskills. I am a kind of shy guy who doesn't like to talk much. In PS-1, we had interactions \nwith faculty and mentor every week. Initially, I asked my other group-mates to convey on \nmy behalf. But gradually I started to speak out and group discussions believe me are the \nbest to improve your spoken language. \nThe  most  important  learning  outcome  from  my  sight  is, I  have  gained  confidence  in \nmyself. Before, the start of PS-1, I thought would I able to do well in an Android project. \nFor me it was a fresh start. Also, I was not good at programming and then when I actually \nstarted  Android  development,  I  worked  on  some  basic  projects  which  boosted  my \nconfidence. Now, I personally feel that I can work with any CS-IS related projects. \n \n \n------------"

In the last week, to finish with the code, we worked on RL module of the code \nusing the concepts of TD learning, experience replay and Actor-Critic policy. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Although  remote  PS-1 seemed  intimidating  at  first. I  settled with  the \nidea and got incredible help from Dr. Prasant Pattnaik, Dr. Rakesh Warier and the industry \nmentor Dr. Samarth. CEERI being a research centre helped me immensely as I wish to \ngo in a similar direction pursuing AI. Also, I should add that the team I belong to had very \naccommodating and understanding colleagues and I think our team work was amazing, \nwithout which being so, we would have had a hard time.To sum it up, it was all I'd ever \nwished for. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: About  PID  controllers  as  an  extension  to  what  we  learnt  in  II-II, \nreinforcement  learning (Q-learning,  Deep  Q-learning,  policy  gradient  and  more), soft \nskills, working in a team, and a great platform to implement all this. \n \n \n------------"

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up  \n \nShort summary of work done: The ability to monitor and control the flow of water in real-\ntime  can  be  invaluable  as  one  can  detect  and  seal  off  leaks  with  minimal  effort.  The \npractical realization of such models, however, is easier said than done, as the outward \nsimplicity of the system belies the complexity and magnitude of the problem. The design \nof a smart network capable of monitoring a given water distribution system must take into \naccount the maximization of resource utilization while still providing near-comprehensive \ncoverage over large areas, be able to stand the test of time, and still transmit essential \ndata  swiftly.  The  work  done  during  PS-I  is  a  humble  attempt  at  finding  a  solution  to  a \nreduced version of the problem. Instead of seeking to monitor every aspect of the system, \n\n54 \n \nwe attempt to find a generalized model specifically optimized for the detection of leaks \nwithin  the  water  distribution  system.  Modeling  and  simulation  of  the  water  distribution \nsystem  have  been  conducted  on  the  EPANET  platform.  The  data  generated  from  the \nEPANET  simulations  have  been  used  for  training  the  machine  learning  model,  a  deep \nneural network, capable of predicting leaks in the water grid. A scheme has also been put \nforth for leak-localization. MySQL has been proposed as a feasible local platform for data \nstorage.  The  EPANET model  will  have  to  be  validated  by  comparing  it  with  real-life \npressure   data.   Lora  WAN  has   been   proposed  as  the  most  suitable   IoT  based \ncommunication  protocol  with  a  module  consisting  of Lara WAN  and  Arduino  with  Lora \ngateway acting as an interface. Industry-standard sensors for collecting the pressure data \nin the network have also been proposed. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: PS-I  provided  a  unique opportunity  to  interact  with  industry  mentors \nand  work  with  students  of  various  disciplines  to  learn  and  gain  experience  about  the \nconcepts and techniques that are currently being used in the industry. Since this year, the \nPS-I is conducted online rather than the regular offline PS-I, this was my first experience \nof  working  on  a  project  online.  The  interaction  with  an  industry  mentor  and  faculty \ninstructor  was  mostly  done  through  Google  Meets  which  was  a  completely  different \nexperience  as  compared  to  meeting  them  in-person.  the  interaction  usually  took  place \nwith  video  off  and  only  through  the  microphone.  This  type  of  interaction  made  it  a  bit \ndifficult  for  me  to  express  the  concerns,  doubts,  opinions  to  the  mentor  and  faculty \ninstructor. There was no hands-on experience in developing the hardware which would \nhave been possible if it would have been an offline PS-1. This made it difficult to show \naccurate  results  and  physical  implementations  in  the  project  virtually  through  google \nmeets. But this gave us the experience to struggle for ideas and think out of the box to \npresent  the  results  and  simulations  to  the  mentor  and  instructor.  The  communication \nbetween the team members mostly took place through Whatsapp rather than direct face \nto  face  talk.  This  reduced the  amount  of  interaction  between  us  but  everyone  started \nasking the progress of each other's work which led me to the experience querying others \nconfidently.  The  entire  evaluation  scheme  put  forth  for  the  online  PS-1 helped  me \ncomplete the project gradually at a regular pace step by step. The evaluation components \nlike  quiz,  dairy,  seminar,  project  report  helped  me  to  continuously  learn  new  things \nregarding  my  project  and  gain  experience  in  writing  dairy,  report  for  planning  and \nrecording the concepts and progress in the project. The evaluation component like group \ndiscussion helped me to learn something unique about my project domain and helped me \nimprove  my  soft  skills.  My  entire  PS-I  was  an  excellent  experience  in  putting  forth  an \nindustry-standard project. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: My  learning  outcomes  of  the  PS-I  include  learning  of  both  the \nconcepts in developing the project and components involved in recording the progress of \nthe project. Concepts learned in developing the project: EPANET, water simulation and \nhydraulic  modeling  software  can  simulate  water  grids  using  pressure-driven  analysis. \nEmitters in EPANET can be used to model leakages in the water grid. Any leakage will \nresult in deviations in pressure, flow, and other parameters in the network. This fact can \nbe used for leak detection and localization. MySQL is a feasible option for the storage of \ndata  generated  by  IoT  devices  and  for  exporting  data  in  a  format  usable  for  machine \n\n55 \n \nlearning  applications.  Sensor  placement  is  optimized  to  minimize  costs. Sensors  have \nbeen designed keeping power efficiency and reliability in mind. Industry-grade sensors \nhave  been  proposed,  controlled  by  easily-available  micro-controllers  like  Arduino and \nRaspberry Pi in order to make a cheap sensor package capable of lasting for years. Lora \nWan has been chosen as the communication protocol as it fulfills the requirements of the \nproject the best out of commonly available options. Components learnt in recording the \nprogress of the project: The evaluation components like quiz and seminar helped me to \ncontinuously learn new things regarding my project and the components like dairy and \nproject report helped me to gain experience in writing a dairy and a report for planning, \nand recording the concepts and progress of the project. The evaluation component like \ngroup  discussion  helped  me  to  learn  something  unique  about  my  project  domain  and \nhelped me improve my soft skill levels. The overall learning outcomes were the concepts, \ntools and techniques in developing a project from the beginning to the end. \n \n \n------------"

The  project  topic  was  Investigation  of  non-contact  IR  temperature \nsensor  for  COVID-19 detection.  The  sub-project  allocated  to  me  was  investigation  of \nsensing  techniques  for  human body.  So  essentially,  I  was  supposed  to  do  intensive \nresearch  on  the  most  common  temperature  sensing  techniques  like  microbolometers, \nthermocouples, thermopile sensors, LM35 etc. and based on my research recommend \nthe appropriate sensing technique for the purpose at hand. To help with the research, I \nwas  also  supposed  to  simulate  these  sensing  techniques  on  the COMSOL  simulation \nplatform,  which  helped  me  in  comparing  their  workings  practically.  The  key  points  to \nconsider while researching the sensing techniques were accuracy, precision, availability \nand  most  importantly  cost  effectiveness  of  the  sensing  technique  for  large  scale \nimplementation. Thermocouples and thermopile sensors are relatively older technologies \nwith lower precision but extremely cheap and available universally.  Microbolometers use \nthe cutting edge MEMS technology but most of the cheaper variants are still in R&D stage. \nResearching on the specifics of these sensing techniques was one of the key ideas of the \nresearch. Aside from this, online youtube videos and tutorials had to been scanned for \n\n61 \n \nmore information on working of these sensing techniques. Several research papers were \nprovided by the mentor on this topic which I had to go through in order to gain a better \nunderstanding of the project. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  work  from  home  nature  of  my  PS-1 made  it  relatively  unique. \nAlthough, the experience might not be as close to as a regular PS-1 would offer, but it did \noffer some valuable learning oppurtunities. The distant learning mode and managing to \nalways interact with our mentor and PS-1 faculty online from time to time was good skill \nto  learn.  Aside  from  this,  I  was  able  to  incorporate  a  lot  of  research  aptitude  in  myself \nwhich I have actually been wanting to do for quite some while. The research was also on \nvery trending topic - the current pandemic of COVID-19 and hence felt like it had a lot of \nvalue.  The  seminars  were  amazing  ways  to  actually  learn  on  how  to  do  formal \npresentations and how to prepare for the same. The group discussion was also fun to do, \nespecially since it was an online mode through Google Meet. The weekly diaries gave an \noppurtunity to reflect on the work done in the previous week. To be able to actually interact \nwith a scientist from CEERI, Pilani and able to know his research domain was an amazing \nexperience. All in all, it was a pretty unique experience. \n \n \nLearning outcome: The biggest learning outcome was the research aptitude I built over \nthe course of 6 weeks. I gained massive insight into the sensing techniques available in \nthe  market  and  was  eventually  able  to  provide recommendation  on  the  ideal  sensing \ntechnique  in  current  context.  I  improvised  on  some  soft  skills  like  communication  and \ndelivering presentations through online mode. The group discussion also enhanced the \ndebating skills. I was able to learn lot about the work going on at CEERI, Pilani and about \nthe research domains of scientists working over there. A very new and unique simulation \ntool  called  COMSOL  was  also  introduced  and  I  eventually  learnt  how  to  operate  this \ncomplex platform and gain an idea of simulations practically through this tool. \n \n \n------------"

A pyroelectric sensor falls under thermal sensors that responds to rate of change \nof  temperature.  Due  to  change  in  heat  flux  through  few  materials,  free  charges  are \ngenerated on the surface. That’s about the basics. We used COMSOL multiphysics 5.5 \nto  model.  For  starters,  we  modelled  resistive  coil  of  platinum  on  a  glass  substrate.  It \ndemonstrated Joule’s heating. Later, pyroelectric sensor was modelled. It had sensing \nelement and mechanical support. Dimensions were in microns. Our team of 3, each chose \n\n62 \n \n2  different  pyroelectric  materials.  We simulated  model  for  different  wavelength  and \nradiation power. Simulation results were exported to MS Excel. We wrote MATLAB script \nto get plots for each material. Conclusions were derived, wavelength had no significant \neffect  and current  showed  linear rise  with  increasing  power.  This  gave  sensitivity.

In  today’s  world,  projects  related  to  inland  water \ntransportation are considered as one of the options available for humanity to curb carbon \nfootage.  Collision  in  Inland  waterways  represent  the  biggest  threat  to  inland  water \ntransportation; its occurrence is very infrequent but has bad consequences that makes \nits avoidance a very imperative factor. Collision Risk Index (CRI) plays an important role \nfor  assessing  ship  to  ship  and  ships  to  shore  (river  bank)  collision.  The  automatic \nidentification  system (AIS)  has  been  used  to  support  navigation,  abnormal  traffic \ndetection,  collision  prediction  and  route  estimation.  The  AIS  datasets  also  help  to \ncalculate  CRI. The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  identify  all  the  techniques  that  have  been \ndeveloped so far, which enable us to derive collision avoidance system that gives collision \nrisk of ship w.r.t other ships moving in that area and w.r.t shore or bank of river in Inland \nwaterways based on Automatic Identification System data. I have chosen Hooghly River \nfor it. Much of the research that has taken place is basically for vessel to vessel collision \nin the IOR and other oceans. I had developed a risk assessment model for the ship to \nship collision as well as ship to shore.

We were able to design the logic but not implement it \nbecause of complete online mode of working due to COVID-19. By doing this project I \nwas able to develop understanding of network traffic in computer networks and explore \nthe domain of cybersecurity for first time. We read lot of research papers and analysed \nexisting solutions given in them related to our project. We developed an analytical ability \nto understand which algorithm works best for practical implementation of hash value using \nnetwork  protocol  fields  and  on  basis  of  our  literature  review,  we  designed logic  and \nsuggested it to company via group presentation. \n \n \nPS-I experience: As this time PS-1 was conducted completely in online mode, we were \nnot able to get a hands on  industry experience.

In the past, this usually meant mirroring the packet as a \nwhole and analyzing its contents. However, this involves the processing of large amounts \nof data which poses an issue when dealing with high speed data streams. Flow analysis \ninvolves gathering only header info - the most common combination being the IP 5-tuple \nof  source  IP  address,  destination IP  address,  source  port  address,  destination  port \naddress and IP protocol. This info is much more concise and can be stored and analysed \nfaster, with more efficient memory usage. This sort of analysis looks at parameters like \nthe volume of certain flow and the frequency at which new packets are sent.

Learnt how to work \nwith MATLAB, a basic understading on Simulink, I was able to get good understanding \non  electronics,  overcame  the  stage  fear  through  the  midsem  presentation,  got  to \ncommunicate with many people regarding the project and discussing the issues, gained \ncommunication skills, made myself familiar with the presentations and ppts, I learnt how \nto make report by guidelines and sample documents shared by our PS-1 instructor Dr. \nSwapna. I learnt how actually group discussion should be through the guidelines of my \nPS-1 instructor. I also gained confidence of proving myself better in the next GD wherever \nit  might  be  there  because  of  this  first  attempt.  We  got free  subscription  of  MATLAB \nR2020b for all the students from our institute. I have downloaded the software and got to \nknow it better. With the help of the videos available in the canvas (LMS) platform, I am \nable  to  understand  the  concept  of  Simulink  in much  clearer  way.  With  the  quiz  held,  I \nhave also gained much knowledge of conductors. Learnt much about grounding and their \nprotection techniques.  Once  again  through  the  seminar 2,  I  was  able  to  overcome  my \nstage fear to the fullest and was able to give my best in the presentation.  \n \n \nLearning  outcome: We  had quiz  on  the  company  through  which  I  got  to  know  much \nabout my station. Learnt about the protection techniques followed in PowerGrid as part \nof my project report. Our instructor gave us the guidelines for the presentation and shared \nfew important template documents of the project report and seminar. I learnt more about \nprotection  techniques  in  an  electric  station.  Which  includes  isolation,  insulation  and \ngrounding  through  the  documents  shared  by  my  mentor  and  also  through  internet.  I \nstarted working on grounding systems. Started working on my second presentation which \nmainly focuses on grounding systems. Gone through all the materials shared by my PS-\n1 mentor and also through the internet on grounding systems. The importance of the de-\nenergized conductor. Its properties and working principle. Methods to detect the presence \nof the induced voltage. Protection techniques used to prevent workers from entering the \ndangerous  places.  The  grounding  systems  and  its  objectives  at  the  worksite.  The \nimportance  of  the  protective  grounds  in  the  installation  of  the  grounding  system.

The project was \nabout  how to  detect  faulty  cell  in  VRLA  battery  in  Power  Grid.  To  detect  faulty  cell  it \nrequired microchip, debugger etc. In this project, PIC16F15214 microprocessor is used. \nMicrochip cost is very low and a program is also available with microchip. I studied the \nmaster-slave  setup  used  in  the  schematic  diagram. Study  about  various  PIN modes in \nchip. Since, transferring data is very important role of this project so, I also learnt about \ndata communication. Analog data transmission is not possible due to delay distortion and \nsignal amplification. I also get familiar with various terms like baud rate, clock rate etc. \nSince  data  correction  cannot  be  100%  accurate.  So, filters  are  used  in  this  project.  In \nMODBUS certain filters are defined in C language libraries in which the instruction set to \nbe executed is written. I learnt about parity bit filter and modulo 2 filter. There are more \nadvanced filters like CRC filter which can’t be done by parity bit filter and modulo 2 filter. \nTo study the entire project can take few months. The project is also in developing stage. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-1  experience  was  good.  I  was  in  this  project  with  2  more \nstudents from Hyderabad. Our mentor is from Bangalore station. The project was about \n\n127 \n \nhow  to detect faulty  cell  in VRLA  battery  in Power  Grid. The experience  studied under \nhim  was good  opportunity.  But  due  to  COVID-19 situation, the  platform  was  online \nbetween us. That’s why I feel like I literally miss beautiful opportunity working in Power \nGrid  because  we  can  get  knowledge  through  online  platform.  But  to  see  different \nprograms, machine setups and various sectors in Power Grid is different. Also after mid \nsemester, we can’t in contact with our mentor for big period of time because he has lot of \nwork in Power Grid. Communication during PS-1 was very less between our group and \nmentor. Due to his busy schedule, we can only talk with him in the evening for one hour. \nBut the good part is that our mentor still teach us about this project in short interval of \ntime. I really enjoyed this project during PS-1 under him. If the platform is the real power \ngrid center then working experience can be amazing. \n \n \nLearning outcome: Our project was about detecting faulty cell in VRLA battery in Power \nGrid center. I understand some new things like data communication / transmission, data \ncorrection, MODBUS protocol and devices like microcontroller, debugger etc.  I also learnt \nsome new skills like group discussion, presenting a report through online platform etc. \n \n \n------------"

We had  also \nextracted  data  on  value  chain  analysis  by  talking  to  the  company  representative  of \ndifferent  firms  which  are  involved  in  these  distribution  channels.  We  got  a  rough  idea \nabout  the  different  players  involved  in  value  chain  and  what  percent  they  contribute  in \nthe market retail price of the commodity. From all these plotted data, I calculated fixed \nand variable cost of the particular commodity and by the use of fixed and variable costs \n(transport  cost), I  calculated  break  even  point. At    last, viable business  model  was \nprepared  to  help  the  producer  companies  which  were  operated  by  economically \n\n15 \n \nmarginalized groups (poor farmers, tribal farmers, weavers, non timber forest gatherers, \netc). So, basically what we did is get data on how much price the distribution channels \nsell  to  consumers  and  on  how  much  price  these  channels  buy  from  the  producer \ncompanies. Difference on these two prices was calculated and analysed thoroughly and \ntried  to  minimize  the  role  of  middle  man  so  that  producer  can  get  high  profit and \nconsumer can get the commodity at less price. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  good  PS faculty  and  as  well  as  my  reporting  officer  was  very \nhelpful an I would like to thank my PS faculty Dr Pravin M.

The    goal  of  the  project  was  to  understand  and  optimize \nongoing  operations  at AlmaConnect.  A major  chunk  of  the  operations  at  AlmaConnect \nrevolve  around  the  customer  data  points  which  is  mainly  job  posts  data,  applications \ndata,  mail  campaigns  and  calls.  Our  primary  work at  the  company  revolved  around \nmarket research, data analysis and product management. \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS-1 was great experience to learn and apply textbook knowledge. It \ngave  us  a  great  way  to  interact  with  industry  experts.  We  were  made  to  work \ncomprehensively  in  the  above  mentioned  three  domains - Market  research,  data \nanalysis  and  product  management.  The  work  at  AlmaConnect  was  significant  not  in \nterms of load, but rather the sort of impact it made, we could see the real life impact on \nusers,  signups  and  clients  and  how  our  decisions  were  directly  responsible  for  the \nimpact  it  created.  I  was  given  multiple  market  research  tasks  where  I  had  to  create \nreports for companies struggling or generating revenue during the COVID-19 crisis and \nthis   gave   me   a   great   overview   of   how   companies   and   businesses   operate.   I \nimplemented a personalized sign up system for a small number of potential users to see \nthe impact of personalization and I noticed a great increase in the number of signups. I \nperformed  end  user  testing  and  reported  bugs  in  the  mobile  browser  variant  of  the \nAlmaConnect website. I learnt how to perform competitive benchmarking and learnt how \nto  compare  products  based  on  functionalities,  revenue  models  and  a  variety  of  other \nthings.  I  performed  data  analysis  mainly  using  Excel  and  analyzed  the  data  to  find \ntrends  or  patterns  that  would  improve  the  business  operations  of  the  company.  I  was \nallotted  a  task  where  I  had  to  pump  new posts  into  the  feed  to  see  how  customer \nengagement  can  be  increased  and  in  order  to  that  I  had  to  first  analyze  the  particular \nnetwork this was being done in.

This  also  helped \nimprove my interpersonal communications skills. I learnt what goes into making an idea \ninto  an  actual  product  or  feature.  We  had  some  brainstorming  sessions  on  how  to \nimprove  the  product  and  that  improved  our  critical  thinking  ability.  I  learnt  how  to \nanalyze  a  product  and  how  to  compare  it  to  its  competitors  and  learn  how  to  make  it \nstand apart. I learnt how startups operate and how they are structured. I learnt business \nanalytics and learnt how to analyze revenue models and learnt how to optimize revenue \nstreams.  I  learnt  how  UI/UX  designing  is  done and  saw  how  small  things  like pop-up \ncan lose customer engagement. With the UI/UX design knowledge in mind, I also learnt \nhow to perform end user testing in a structured way, taking into consideration UI/UX and \ngave  suggestions  to  improve  based  on  it.  I  implemented  a  new  personalized sign  up \nsystem for a test and that gave me a lot of insight on how such tasks boost the number \n\n20 \n \nof sign ups on the portal.

The project involved an economic analysis in Europe, Asia and the \nUS.  There  are  several  economic  indicators  to  look  upon  in  the  petroleum  market  and \noverall energy sector, but we were expected to look upon the main areas only, namely \ndemand, supply,  refining,  inventories. Furthermore,  these  4  topics  had  around  7  to  8 \nsub-topics each and we were supposed to collect data from government websites, EIA, \nEurostat,  OECD  etc,  and  organize  the  data  collected  in  seamless  time  series  using  \npivot  tables  in  Excel,  then  2D  charts  were  plotted  for  data visualization  for  both last  5 \nyears and last 10 years. Data visualization is an accessible way to see and understand \ntrends, outliers and patterns in data.

We \nalso  learnt  to  use  one  of  the  most  popular  terminal  \"Bloomberg\"  for  collecting  data of \ndifferent  European  and  Asian  countries.  Different  factors  we  worked  upon  in  this \nresearch  for  different  countries  were  GDP,  population  growth,  manufacturing  activity \nindex  such  as  PMI,  (monthly),  oil  demand,  sales,  exports  of  crude  oil  and  refined \nproducts   (everything   broken-up   by   products,   grade   and   regions),   motor   vehicle \nproduction,  monthly  refined  petroleum  consumption  etc.  in  both  absolute  as  well  as \nrelative  terms (Mom  and  YoY), imports  of  crude  oil  and  refined  products  (everything \nbroken-up by products, grade and regions), crude oil production, petroleum and liquids \nproduction  (monthly),  petroleum  and  other  liquid  stocks,  primary  production,  refining \ncapacity,  oil stock  changes  etc.  This  helped  in  analyzing  the  historical  trend  for  these \nfactors  in all  the  countries  chosen  as  well  as  we  also  indicated  the  current  year  2020 \nprogress for these indicators. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The overall experience was good, we learnt to do economic analysis \nand  handling  huge  amounts  of  data  and  gathering  useful insights  from  data,  the  only \ndrawback  was  being  a  virtual  internship  it  was  quite  tough  to  communicate  with  each \nother on a regular basis and to keep a track of each other's progress. Yet we learned a \nlot about the energy sector of different regions across the globe and with the support of \nour Industry mentor we managed to complete our project on time. \n \n \nLearning outcome: We learnt data collection from credible websites and got a hands-\non experience on Bloomberg terminal, we also learnt Pivot tables for auto updating data \n\n48 \n \nand  auto-adjusting  graphs,  we  finally  learnt  plotting  2D  area  charts  instead  of  regular \nline  graphs,  these  charts  indicated  the  region  between  different  ranges  maximum, \naverage,  minimum  and  doing  economic  analysis,  also  we  improved  upon  some  of  the \nsoft  skills  like time  management,  collaboration  and  teamwork,  communication  skills, \ncritical thinking etc. \n \n \n------------"

And  then, do  the  financial  analysis  of  the  filings \nobtained. We first chose a sector (the Pharmaceutical sector) and with the help of SEC \nand it’s database EDGAR, extracted a list of 1503 companies. Then with the help of a \nweb-scraping tool (which was created using Python), we got the individual 10-K and 10-\nQ  filings  of  each  company.  These  filings  contain  multiple  excel  sheets  such  as \nstatements  of  earnings, balance sheets,  statement  of operations  and  other  relevant \ndata. We took most  of  the  parameters present  in  a 10-K file  such as  net income, total \nassets, total  liabilities, shareholders’ equity and many more. We then created a code \nthat  extract  these  parameters  and  store  it  in  a  CSV  file.  After  the  data  extraction  was \ndone, we  consolidated  the  data  in  a  single  file  and  then  proceeded  to  calculate  the \nvarious derived parameters such as gross profit, net worth and the numerous financial \nratios (like debt to equity ratio, quick ratio, return on equity etc.) and then we performed \nfinancial analysis. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  really  good.

We have used random forests and cluster analysis to help us to the \nclassification  of  news. For  news  classification,  we  implemented  the  Random  Forests \nalgorithm  and  trained  our model  on  the  publicly  available  BBC  dataset  on  Kaggle*. \nRandom Forests classifier grows multiple decision trees from randomly selected subset \n\n81 \n \nof  training  set.  In  order  to  classify  each  new  object  from  the  input  vector,  we  need  to \nplace  the  input  vectors  below  each of  these  decision  trees  in the forest  with  each  tree \nhaving its own decision. The final classification is based on the aggregate of the votes \nof  the  decision  trees. We  implemented  the  PyTextRank  model  to  carry  out  text \nsummarization.  It  is  a  Python  based spacy  pipeline  extension  used  to  implement \nextractive  text  summarization.  The  model  is  quick  to  run  and  does  not  need  to  be \ntrained. Hence, it has low processing needs and can be integrated easily with the rest of \nthe models through and can interact easily with the user interface. After the sentences \nin the text are separated, they are ranked based on the TF metrics of each sentence in \nthe given similarity matrix and graph. The top most ranked sentences are then chosen \nto  generate  the  summary  of  the text. Sentiment  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the \nSentiWordNet Opinion Lexicon. The primary reason of adopting it is because we had to \nopt  for  unsupervised  learning  methods  due  to the unavailability  of  supervised  dataset \nwhich  incorporate  the  corresponding  polarity  in  a  continuous  form  i.e.  in  a  range. \nSentiWordNet  is  one  of  the  most  advanced  opinion  lexica  which  is  publicly  available. \nAlong  with  that,  it  continuously  updates  its  future  versions  as  it  is built  on  a  semi-\nautomated process. For calculating polarity score of the news piece, we have used the \nweighted  average  of  sentiment  scores  of  each  pre-processed  token.  The  weights  are \ndecided on the grounds of the impact of an individual token on the opinion of the text. \nThe  output  received  is  in  the  range  of  (-1,  1)  which  is  amplified  using  the  exponential \nfunction and magnified to a range of (10, 10). The sentiment is termed as positive for a \nscore greater than 1, negative for a score less than -1 and neutral for a score between 1 \nand -1.  The  main  drawback  of  the  model  is  that  it  is  not  very  efficient  in  carrying  out \nsector-specific comparison since the model is designed to accommodate news articles \nfrom all kinds of background. Figure 5 frames the average sentiment of front page’s \nnews articles of a major daily for a span of two months. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Over  the  past  six  weeks,  I  have  thoroughly  enjoyed  working  on  the \nproject and have learnt a lot. Though communication was a bit weak but the experience \nof  work  and  exposure  to  new  topics  kept  me  interested  all  along.  Thank  you  for  this \nwonderful opportunity. \n \nLearning  outcome: I have  been  exposed to  the  experience  of  working  in  an  industry. \nAdding  to it,  I  have  gained  knowledge  in  Python  and  machine  learning  and  various \nlibraries  for  project  purpose.  I have  gained  soft  skills  and  proper  communication  skills \nwith my mentors and team mates. \n \n \n------------"

These  people \ninclude rural officers  or  panchayat  officials  looking  for  training  programs,  research \nstudents  looking  for  data  or  publications,  students  looking  for  PGDM  course  etc.  My \nchatbot aims to help them to navigate through the site focusing on their purpose of visit. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Frankly,  I  was  skeptical  with  the  PS-1 initially,  given  that  I  hadn't \nwritten  a  single  line  of  code  in  the  first  three  weeks  of  the  internship.  However,  I  later \nrealised just how crucial this proposal drafting, architectural decision documentation and \ndialogue  flow  design  was  in  the  process  of  building  a  bot.  My  initial  work  involved \ncoming  up  with  the  methodology  and  analytical  framework,  literate  review  of  existing \nchatbot  researches,  use  case  identification  and  conversation  flow  implementation. \nThese  documents  me  much  better  acquainted  to  the  sitemap  of  NIRDPR  website  and \nproved to be invaluable assets when I actually started  building the bot. With the design \nphase  done  and  dusted,  it was  time  to  build  a  chatbot  on  dialogflow.  After  getting \nacquainted to concepts such as agents and intents, I began defining intents with 10-20 \ntraining phrases each. In order to ensure the chatbot is suitable for the Indian audience, \nI included Hinglish phrases, slangs and opinion changes in between. Continuous testing \nwas  carried  out  throughout  the  development  phase  to  ensure  the  chatbot  doesn't  get \nstumped. When  it  came  to  the  final  demonstration,  my  bot  performed  excellently  and \nwas  able  to  recognise  statements  such  as  'm  a  skool  student'  and  'ye  online  courses \nkya hai', which was obviously a moment of immense pride for me. As they say, all's well \nthat ends well ! \n \n \nLearning  outcome: I  learnt  how  to  draft  a  proposal  and  workplan  for  software \ndevelopment  projects,  involving  ideas  such  as  SDLC  waterfall  model,  use case \nidentification  and  derive  analytical  framework  by  investigating  high  level  architecture. \nOnce I was done with this planning and ideation phase, I also built a MVP, which taught \nme  how  to  develop  bots  using  dialogflow  and  dealing  with  concepts  such  as intents, \nentities and parameters.

I'm very grateful \nthat I learnt lot and am also very thankful for the efforts of our student mentor Mr. Ritwik \nKinra who put in the hours in the meetings to teach us new things. Our project was very \ncrucial as  we had to learn about everything  on telephone and web based surveys and \nhow India should go about conducting research, now that face-to-face interviews are not \npossible due to COVID-19. We had to cover all of this into a report for the organization. \nFirst of all, we started our work by covering all the different sectors which were affected \nby  COVID-19,  then  we  learnt  everything  about  conducting  an  effective  survey  and \nquestionnaire  on  various  platforms.  We  were  also  given  insight  on  the  status  of  crime \nvictimization  survey  in  India  which  is  in  the  process  of  making  in  the  organization. We \nworked on the effectiveness of computer assisted- telephone and web based interviews. \nWe  collected  20  research  papers  per  person  in  the  group  which  were  related  to \ncomputer  assisted  telephone  and  web  based  interviews,  surveys  held  in  different \ncountries. We then selected the most suitable research papers for our work and wrote \neffective summaries involving the methods used by the researchers in their papers. We \nalso  had  some  books  based  on  different  surveys  etc  involved  for  our  research. In  the \nend, we gave all of our findings of the summary into the report. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was a tough challenge for me as the work load was very heavy but \nI'm very happy that I was able to put in a lot of effort and I really feel I have improved a \nlot mentally from before on my work ethic. \n \n \n\n115 \n \nLearning outcome: Learnt how to briefly present the work to others and how to work in \ncoordination with others as a team, how to view a summary from a critics point of view, \nhow  to  go  about  extracting  information  from  research papers, how  to  put  down  all  the \nfindings of the summary into a single report.  \n \n \n------------"

Most of the tasks allotted \nto  me  were  technical,  where  primarily  I  used  Excel  and  Python  to  manoeuvre  the \nstatistical technicalities of the project.

This  project  began \nwith the exploration of the life insurance industry, various companies existing in the life \ninsurance  industry  in  India  and  which  are  the  major  competitors  of  Pramerica  Life \nInsurance  company,  the  challenges  faced  by these  companies  during  the  COVID-19 \nand  their  working  methodologies.  It  is  followed  about  various risks  and  the  impact  of \nCOVID-19 on those risk management due to pandemic. Risk management is the activity \nof  recognising  the  risk,  risk  assessment,  developing strategies  to  manage  it  and \nmitigation  of  risk  using  managerial  skills.  The  future  of  life  insurance  industry  will \nundoubtedly  rest  on  risk  management  dynamics.  Only  those  companies  that  have \nefficient risk management system will overcome the economic recession caused by the \npandemic.  The  effective  management  of  credit  risk,  underwriting  risk,  liquidity  risk  and \noperational are a critical components of comprehensive risk management essential for \nlong-term  success  of any life  insurance  company.  We  found  that  these  risks  have \nchanged   and   have   increased   manifolds   during   recent   times   and   that   existing \nprocedures  of  risk  management  are  not  sufficient  to  compete  with  the  challenging \nfinancial and economic environment. Now, companies have become extra cautious and \nare now more focused on survival  rather than on growth. The company managements \nare  trying  to  avoid  any  mistake  that  could  prove  fatal  for  the  company.  This  project  is \nconcluded with some suggestions and risk mitigation techniques that will help these life \ninsurance companies to sustain in the volatile market. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: There  were lot  of  learning  experiences  in  the  entire  internship. \nInitially, we  faced  some  issues  in  getting  details  about  our  project  from  the  industry \nmentor during the initial two weeks which resulted in us, randomly learning things which \nwe  thought  could  be  important  when  we  would  get  the  project  details.  The  PS-1  was \nproperly managed and executed in the virtual mode. The Canvas system was easy and \nintuitive to use. Also, the numerous webinars conducted were very helpful. Those help \nme to  understand  the  subjects very  well  and  also,  I  could  know  about  the  numerous \nopportunities  available  in  this  domain.  Evaluation  methods  were  properly  structured  to \nmake  sure  that  the  student  is properly  learning  and  is  making  progress.  Though, our \nindustry  mentor  did  not  respond  much  and  did  not  give  much  inputs  as  he  was  very \nbusy regarding his company. But having an ever ready to help faculty in-charge was a \nbenefit for us. He specialized in the domain which our project belonged to. Hence, with \nadequate inputs and guidance from him, we were able to complete our project. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: Corporate  world is  not  buttery  smooth.  Ups  and  downs  are \nessential part of it. Learning to tackle and cooperate in every such situation was major \nlearning.  Communication  skills  are  also  a  major  learning.  Technical  skills  like  data \nanalysis, risk management, Bloomberg terminal were also essential learning outcomes. \n \n \n\n128 \n \n------------"

This  included  assisting  the  CSR \nadvisory teams at every point they required. To give a brief context what CSR advisory \nteam does: Advisory services focus on helping the clients achieve their vision and goals \nfor  social  impact.  It  consults  on  strategy  for  transformative  ideas  and  models  of  social \nchange, to ensure client success. So basically,  in easy  words, our  job as a part of the \nCSR  advisory  team  was  to  guide  clients  (corporates  mainly)  how  to  spend  their  CSR \nmoney  to  maximize  the  social  impact  as  well  as  the  companies  profit. Now,  doing \nsecondary research is the foundation of any consulting project. I also had a chance to \nspeak with clients about their issues and stuff, and how can we help them. This was a \nvery  front  end  job. One  of  the  most  interesting  project  was  to  prepare  a  proposal  to  a \ncompany  on  \"Impact Branding\"  i.e. using  CSR  to boost  a  companies  image  in market. \nHere,  we  had  to  build  a  strategy  on  how  Sattva  could  achieve  this,  its  timeline,  steps \ninvolved and most importantly pitch on how Sattva is a expert at doing this. I assisted on \nmany  other  projects.  One  of  them  was  the  EVP  (Employee  Volunteering Program), \nwhich  focused  on  virtual  volunteering  during  this  pandemic.  For  example,  company \nemployees  teaching  to  rural  children  online  via  skype. Overall,  it  never  felt  that  I  was \njust  2nd  yearite and  not  a  part  of  Sattva's  family.  The  projects  were  good, well \nstructured and quite exciting. The work load was also balanced. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: This  PS-1  experience  was  one  of  a  kind  which  I  will  never  forget. \nDoing work  remotely  (due  to  this  COVID-19  situation)  was  new  and very  different \nexperience. This way, I (probably we all) learnt to be ready to adapt in every situation, \nno  matter  what  it  is. Talking  about  the  company  Sattva,  it  was  an  overwhelming \nexperience.  Luckily,  I  got  the  PS-1 station  of my  choice,  which  works  to  bring  a  social \nimpact (the field I am highly inclined to, and on top of that working for the society, that \ntoo in such pandemic situation brought a lot of internal happiness and joy). The people \nat Sattva were highly helpful and treated me as a part of their family. I made a lot of new \nfriends  there.  We  had  work  meetings,  team  meetings,  webinars,  fun  sessions,  intern \nactivities. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: The  most  important  learning  was  to  understand  the  office / work \nculture.  This  includes  how  the organization  functions,  meetings,  deadlines  and  time \nmanagement  skills. The major  skills  I  acquired  were:  secondary  research,  Microsoft \nexcel, data analysis, sending proposals thus improving my communication skills also. \n \n\n145 \n \n \n------------"

The slight increase in the efficiency of the process saves \nmuch and leads to a massive profit for power plants.  \nI initially worked on finding the cause of the issue and analyzing significant areas prone \nto  Corrosion.

The  Platform  consisted  of  an  application  (android  app)  and  a  website. \nThe app is to be used by those employees who are residing in the residencies provided \nby the company for their day to day problems like electrical, plumbing etc. The website \nis  to  be  used  by  the  company  administration  for  the  management  of  the  complaints \nreceived and services provided to them and feedback received. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The total number of participants in the Adani Power, Tirora internship \nwere 11. For the first time practice school 1 was organised in online format. Of course, \nthat was very new experience for me, and I think for our instructors too. This new format \nled in the shrinkage of total span of practice school 1 session to only 6 weeks.  \nSince  the  aforementioned  company  is  in  power  sector  so  the  instructors  were  mainly \nfrom the Mechanical Engineering background. So, the allocation of projects to students \nstarted  one  week  after  the  PS1  date.  Then  we  were  allotted  an  off-campus  mentor.  It \ntook another week to get in contact with the mentor and get all the doubts clarified about \n\n25 \n \nthe project title. So, now  we were left with only four weeks to finish the project with no \nprior  experience  of  app  development.  However,  we  started  the  project  with  the \nprototype development in power point presentation. Initially all of us were very passive \ntowards the project because we got to know that the whole project would be completed \nby  us  without  any  proper  training  sessions  from  the  instructors.  But  soon  we  realised \nthat  the  deadline  of  the  mid-sem  report  was  coming.  Then  I  got  my  guts  on  place  and \nworked extensively. I worked at least eight hours a day for almost a week to complete \nthe presentation containing the prototype of the app and website we would be building. I \ncontacted instructors whenever I required help even at 2 am in the morning. However, \nthe instructors were not of very much helpful by this time. But we were able to complete \nthe prototype two days before the mid-sem presentation. We contacted our off-campus \nmentor  to  look  into  it  and  suggest  changes if  she had  any.  After  seeing  the  prototype, \nher reaction was “how could you make such a beautiful presentation/prototype in such a \nless amount of time?”. “ I am pretty impressed with your work” she added. After then \nshe suggested some changes and we were ready to make the prototype into real app. \nThe mid-sem report was over, but we had no idea on how to make a real app. Then we \ncontacted our mentor. This time she was very helpful in providing resources. She gave \nus the access of BITS WILP platform and suggested some of the videos available there, \nadded us as guest in some of the seminars, and provided some of the materials to read. \nAt the start of the app development we, specially me, were very confused because our \nlearning was very abstract instead of planned. But I worked very hard, at least 10 hours \na day for 3 weeks straight. In the meantime, I got chronic lower back pain which made \nmy  days  even  harder.  We  took  the  help  from  various  sources  like  friends,  YouTube, \nstackexchange.com  etc.  There  were  lots  of  assignments  which  we  had  to  prepare  like \ngroup discussion, seminar, observations etc. So these things also killed our lots of time. \nBut  by  the  time  the  deadline  of  end-sem  report  came,  we  were  almost  ready  with  our \ncompleted  project.  But  instead  of  the  website  for  database  collection  about  which  we \ntalked earlier, we made our app connected with the Google firebase. So, we presented \nour app to the industry and college mentors and they were very happy seeing that. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : Overall, my experience was quite good in this PS station with the \nlots of learning. I learnt a lot about gaining the information from unsystematic sources. \nGot  to  learn  about  working  harder  and  harder  even  when  the  situations  are  not  as \nexpected.

Observing  everything  online  and  understanding  was  quite  a  challenging  job. \nBut it all ended well and I was able to grasp and learn much of the things related to the \nindustry as well as  my branch. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt the basics of Instrumentations and Control Systems which \nwill definitely help me in my future. \nAlso,  i  learnt  about  different  network  topologies,  benefits  of  a  wireless  over  a  wired \ntechnology, basic OISD recommendations for oil and gas industries. \nI  developed  sift  skills  such  as  writing  a  report  in  a  better  way,  public  speaking, \ncoordination, and much more. \nAt last my softwares skills in MS office improved quite lot during writing the report. \n \n \n------------"

Parallely  we \nwere  understanding  about  ASME  codes  for  nozzles.  Then  we  needed  to  Analyse  this \n\n55 \n \nphysical problem with the proper Boundary conditions (Loading and Supports) in Ansys \nsolver.  Before  the  solving  started,  we  needed  to  generate  a  good  quality  hexahedral \nmesh.Then,  we  parametrized  all  the  possible  parameters  of  the  physical  problems  i.e. \nGeometry  Parameters,  Loading  Parameters  and  Material  Properties  Parameters.  For \nGeometry  Parametrization  we  had  to  learn  to  generate  CAD  Model  using  script  in \nSpaceClaim.  After  all  parameters  are  created,  the  simulation  is  done  with  the  default \nvalues of all the parameters provided from BHEL. \nNow we needed to built an user friendly Graphical User Interface which can be used by \na person who does not know Ansys. We choose to create that interface using MS Excel \nas this is the most easy tool to operate for any user. We created an Excel interface with \nthe  same  parameters  and  linked  it  to  the  Ansys  using  IronPython  script.  An  output \nsection  was  also  created  where  all  the  post-processing  results(Max  stress,  Safety \nfactor)  can  be  displayed.

We  had  discussions  with  our  PS  mentor  and  faculty  about  the \nproblem  statement  and  the  general  structure  of  the  project.  In  our  initial  research  we \nlearnt  about  the  factors  affecting  evaporation  and  seepage.  We  learnt  assessment \nmethods  which  allowed  quantification  of  water  losses.  We  were  able  to  group  the \nsolutions   that   we   found   into   three   categories   and   list   their   advantages   and \ndisadvantages. Finally, we estimated the costs of each method and found which method \nserved us best. Throughout this work we read multiple journal articles, research papers, \nstudies  and  statistical  reports  published  both  by  various  governmental  and  private \norganizations.  Other  evaluative  components  included  quizzes,  seminars,  and  group \ndiscussions. Seminars and group discussions, particularly, gave us the push to come up \nwith tangible and genuine ideas and solutions. \nApart from the work done for the project and other evaluative components, we attended \nmultiple  sessions  that  centered  around  various  aspects  of  civil  engineering  domain. \nThese sessions were on cement industry, IoT, Industry 4.0, supply chain management \netc. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: My experience with PS-1 was good. I enjoyed the online sessions that \nwere held and found them very informative. I was also content with the work that I did \nfor  my  project  and  the  knowledge  gained  in  the  process. Working  with  my  friends, \npreparing the report, and practicing for the seminar - all online - was a new experience \nfor  me.  Since  this  PS  was  conducted  online,  I  suppose  it  was  not  as  immersive  as  it \nwould  have  been  in  a  normal  scenario.  I  also  hoped  for  much  more  sessions  when  I \n\n68 \n \nlearned certain PS stations had much more than we had. However, keeping in mind the \nsituation, I feel content and happy with all that was arranged and with the work that was \ndone by our group. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : We  gained substantial  knowledge  on  water  loss  preventive \nmeasures  in  reservoirs.  We  learned  assessment  methods  and  did  cost  estimations. \nGroup  discussion  required  us  to  probe  a  slightly  different  topic,  than  our  project  title, \nwhich  was  \"Groundwater  loss  prevention techniques\".  So,  we  also  gained  knowledge \nabout  the  current  groundwater  predicament  in  the  world  and  especially  in  India.  We \nlearnt about various techniques and policies that were in use and that could be used in \nthe future.  Through  the  online  sessions  we learnt  about  cement  industry,  IoT,  Industry \n4.0,  software  in  use  in  civil  engineering  domain,  GIS  and  supply  chain  management. \nWhile  studying  about  the  project  I  got  an  idea  about  how  to  research  through  multiple \nsources and filter certain ideas and link them together. \n \n \n------------"

We were given different problem statements to work on. For me the \n\n80 \n \nassignment was liquid cooling module manifold for electronic packaging. Thus it was a \nconjugate heat transfer problem. I was required to make a whole timeline of the project \nand lay out a plan, and proceed according to that. The assignment included modelling \nthe  computational  domain  such  that  the  geometry  is  satisfied  and  the  results  are \naccurate.   This   included   more   than   just   changing   settings   in   the   software;   the \nassumptions  needed  to  be  reasonable,  and there  was  a  lot  of  background  research \npaper  reading  required  to  determine  the  necessary  inputs.

Further  to  discussion  with  my \nindustry  mentor,  the work  required  me  to  do  an  in-depth  study  on  the  PAC  production \nprocess  and  the  laboratory  report  on  the  sludge  obtained  at  the  last  stage  of  the \nprocess,  viz.  Filtration.  Ultimately,  the  goal  was  to  develop  practical,  cost  efficient  and \nenvironment  friendly  solutions  for  the  waste  management  of  PAC  sludge,  which  is \n\n97 \n \notherwise  classified  as  'Hazardous  Waste'.  After  detailed  research  and  study  of  all \nexisting   literature   on   the   subject,   I   made   two   suggestions   for   complete   waste \nmanagement of PAC sludge: \n1.  According  to  a  study  by  D.W.  Cho  et  al,  a  Granular  Composite  (GASA)  can  be \nsynthesized  from  hydrothermal  treatment  of  PAC  sludge  followed  by  granulation.  This \ncomposite  can  act  as  an  effective  adsorbent  for  Fluoride  and  can  be  used  to  treat \ngroundwater to remove excess Fluoride from it.  \n2.  According  to  a  study  by  Toor  et  al,  the  sludge  obtained  further  to  wastewater \ntreatment  by  PAC  is  very  rich  in  Phosphorus.  The  phosphorus  present  in  this  sludge \ncan  be  extracted  owing  to  variable  dissolution  of  Phosphorus  from  the  sludge  at \ndifferent  pH  conditions.  The  sludge  obtained  has  the  potential  to  produce  nearly  2.31 \nmillion tons of Phosphorus annually. Also, extraction of Phosphorus from the sludge is \nvery essential because if left in effluent, it can lead to eutrophication in water bodies. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  got  to  work  solo  on  my  allotted  project  helped  me  learn  and  grow \nbeyond what our regular college curriculum allows. I got a better look at the industry and \nits  functioning  and  got  to  improve  my  research  and  presentation  skills.  Also,  I  got  to \nbecome  abreast  with  all  the  current  research  methodology  and  presentation  formats. \nOverall,  despite  the  problem  with  the  PS  station,  it  was  a  good  learning  and  growing \nexperience. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : The outcome was to gain a fair understanding of the industry and \nits functioning with specific focus on the processes taking place at the Grasim Industries \nplant at Renukoot. I was also interested in analyzing the Chemical Engineering industry \nand  its  functioning  in  the  special  circumstances  of  the  Covid-19  lockdown  so  as  to  be \nable to make ourselves relevant to the post Covid world. \n \n \n------------"

I  was \nassigned the project involving the process calculations for viscose production in Grasim \nIndustries.  In  the  subsequent  weeks  I  came  to  know  about  the  different  processes \ninvolved in the viscose production such as steeping, Conditioning, ageing, ripening and \nmany others. Also we as a group did process calculations across different components \nof  the  process  such  as  TRP  (Twin  Roll  Press),  Pulper  etc.  Energy  balance  was  also \ndone by us across the xanthation process, a important part of the viscose production. In \nthe final weeks we learned about the cooling towers, their components, their efficiency \nand how external factors affect their efficiency and how they are significant to the plant. \nAlso, in recurring group discussions we discussed about the production of the Viscose \nStaple  Fiber  affects  the  environment,  and  how  their  impact  can  be  impacted.

Again,  the  CAD  model  was  made  by  incorporating  two  stiffening  rings  and \nstructural integrity was checked. Finally, results were verified with the ASME conditions \nand thus design was accepted. \n \n \nPS-I experience: My experience at IGCAR, Kalpakkam was great. Even though it was \na work from home internship this time yet our PS station put the best of their efforts to \nmake us feel connected to the center and make us involved in our projects. The projects \nallotted to the individuals dealt with the application of engineering knowledge in the real \nworld.  Each  project  was  supervised  by  an  IGCAR  instructor  who  was  an  expert  in  the \nproject  domain.  The  instructor  was  very  co-operative  and  communicated  with  the \nstudents  often.  The  communication  gap  was  never  felt  to  a  great  extend  and  ample \nresources  were  provided  to  understand  every  fundamental  aspect  of  the  project. \nRegular meetings with the IGCAR scientists on different topics enriched our knowledge \nabout  nuclear  plants.  Our  PS  faculty  were  very  helpful  and  responded  to  our  queries \nwithin a short period. We never felt lost about the project and were motivated to further \nunderstand the concepts behind the project. \n \n\n138 \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  learned  a  lot  in  my  PS  duration  in  IGCAR,  Kalpakkam.  The \nproject  allotted  to  me  provided  me  insights  about  the  designing  process and  steps \ninvolved in generating a good model. I gained knowledge about pressure vessels used \nin  the  nuclear  power  plant  and  the  stiffening  ring  used  in  vessels  to  make  it  an \neconomically strong model. Resources such as ASME codes and sample reports made \nme understand the conditions on which parameters are to be designed and how static \nstructural integrity would be verified for the given model. I learned about Finite Element \nAnalysis which is an important part of designing and analyzing the models which are to \nbe practically used. Since my project involved the usage of different types of software, I \nnow have an understanding of a few major commercial software used in the mechanical \nindustry.  Periodic  sessions  about  the  nuclear  plant by  the  IGCAR team  provided  great \nknowledge  about  understanding  of  the  power  generation  in  the  nuclear  plant.  Finally, \nseminars  and  report  presentations  also  enhanced  my  skills  in  communication  and \npresentation which is very essential for working in any industry. \n \n \n------------"

Our  goal  was  to  optimize  the  sensor  to  work  at  around \n500  Deg  Celcius.  For  this  purpose,  we  were  required  to  perform  simulations  with \nvarious  materials  for  different  sensor  parts,  and  to  choose  those  materials  which  can \ngive lowest errors  with temperature increase.

Artificial Neural networks, one of the tools used in machine learning, \nwas  used  to  develop  the  soft  sensor  using  MATLAB  tools  to  determine  the  liquid \ntemperature  of  the  dissolver  of  the  Plant  based  on  the  live  data  from  other  sensor  for \ndissolver  vapour  temperature.  A  detailed  study  was  done  on  neural  networks  and \nnetworks have been chosen for our model based on the properties, constraints and the \namount of data available. This study and analysis of various networks with their results \nhave  been  presented  based  on  the  data  provided  from  the  plant.This  soft  sensor  was  \ndeveloped using  Neural Network and the results were exported. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was amazing and I learnt a lot of new things.

I basically had to \nperform OCR on IC images that were shared with me by implementing YOLO v5 CNN \nfor object detection, EAST R-CNN for text detection, OpenCV for image processing and \nTesseract OCR for text recognition. In all, it was a pretty challenging albeit very exciting \nproject.  A  lot  of  the  data  pre-processing  and  data  wrangling  including  annotation, \nnormalization, etc. was also done to ensure highly accurate output.

The  project  is  to  detect  the  gas  analyte \nfrom  a  mixture  of  gases.  It  is  both  qualitative  as  well  as  quantitative.  so  for  this  we \ndesign a circuit and software for analysis. It is otherwise known as E-nose. so the first \npart of our project is choosing a suitable sensor(MOS, Optical sensors etc). Since each \nsensor  has  a  sensitivity  limited  to  only  few  gases,  we  use  a  sensor  array(group  of \nsensors)  to  enhance  the  sensitivity  of  an  e  nose.  So  we  generally  use  MOS  sensors, \nwhich sense based on the change of resistance of the sensors surface. we use various \nresistance measurement techniques such as multivibrator, wheat stone bridge etc. After \nthis  comes  data  acquisition. We  convert  the  analog  signals  from  the  sensors  to  digital \nequivalents  using  an  ADC  and  send  the  information  to  the  PC  through  various  serial \ncommunication  techniques.  various  data  acquisition  software  can  be  used  such  as \nlabVIEW   which   samples   the   signals.   We   now   use   various   pattern   recognition \ntechniques     such     as     Principal     Component    Analysis(PCA),     Artificial     Neural \nNetworks(ANN) etc. PCA can be used to form a cluster and store it in a data base Now \nafter  performing  the  experiment  we  get  a  few  points  in  the  real  time.  now  in  order  to \ndetermine    to  which  cluster  the  data  point  belongs  to,  we  make  use  of  an  algorithm \ncalled Support Vector Machine(SVM). PCA along with SVM can be used to determine a \ngas  qualitatively.  In  order  to  determine  the  gas  quantitatively  we  make  use  of  few \nalgorithms like PCR, ANN etc. thus like this a gas or a mixture of gases is determines \n \n \nPS-I experience: The journey of PS has been amazing right from the start to the end. \nAlthough initially there were few questions regarding the remote ps program, but it was \na  great  experience  in  itself.

No  matter  how  many  times  we  call  our  mentors,  they \nwere always ready to clear our doubts without any hesitation. We regularly had meets to \ndiscuss the accomplishment of our project. We also had a couple of seminars under the \nsupervision  of  our  mentors  from  IGACR.  Apart  from  seminars  we  also  had  group \ndiscussions,   quizzes,   diary   submissions,   project   reports   etc.   Moreover   our   PS \ninstructors  were  also  very  helpful  in  clearing  all  the  doubts  regarding  the  handling  of \ncanvas.The  experience  of  online  PS  was  great  although  we  had  faced  few  issues  as \nthis was our first time.

Discussions  with  bosses  or  coworkers  are  different \nfrom discussions we usually have with lecturers or fellow students. \nAnother  thing  we  learnt  is  learn  how  to  work  independently.  Often,  we  think  being \nspoon-fed  is  the  way  to  learn,  but  working  independently  has  proved  to  be  very \nimportant.  This  internship  taught  us  how  to  make  decisions on  our  own,  or  with  little \nguidance, which is very important in the working world. \n \n\n160 \n \n \n------------"

My project was to work on speed control using VFDs of different rated pulses \nfor manufacturing operations in the hydrocarbon industry. Due to the lockdown, we were \nnot  able  to  know  about  the  practical  operation  of  VFD  in  the  industry  and  most  of  our \nproject was based on simulation based studies. Due to unavailability of license for using \nthe  software,  we  had  to  use  links  on  the  internet  for  running  simulations.  However, \ndespite  these  limited  means  we  got  a  lot  of  insight  in  the  project.  We  were  provided \nmaterial to study by our mentor for getting a grip on the concepts required to understand \nthe project.

We \nhad a team of 4 students. The first was our orientation with the MD of Nandi Group of \nCompanies. And in the following week we had a meet with our industry mentor. He was \nthe  one  who  explained  to  us  our  objectives  and  needed  outcomes. We  were  asked  to \nfirst study the several procedures used till now in the industry to create aftershaves.

One  was  a  market  research  of  raw \nmaterials  with  objectives  to  find  the  main  players  in  the  raw  material  manufacturing \nindustry along with their respective plant capacities and market distribution. We had to \npresent  our  research  in  front  of  our  industry  mentors.  This  information  was  crucial  to \nthem  since  Nerolac  is  in  the  position  of  acquiring/tying  up  with  companies  all  over  the \n\n215 \n \nworld  to  help  reduce  their  cost  as  well  as  to  build  a  name  for  themselves  and  stamp \ntheir  authority  on  the  global  map.  The  second  project  which  we  got  was  on  Robotic \nProcess   Automation.   Nerolac   has   been   wanting   to   automate   many   of   their \nprocess/tasks   within  the   company   to   reduce   time,   build   accuracy   and   be  more \nproductive  than  the  rest  of  their  competitors  and  thus  have  a  slight  edge  over  them  in \nthe  future.  Our  work  was  to  research  about  RPA  for  a  start  and  then    find  companies \nthat  have  implemented  RPA  in  their  respective  companies  along  with processes  that \nthey have automated. We also had to find the key points on how it helped the respective \ncompanies and share all our findings through an excel sheet. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  internship  was  a  decent  experience,  while  I  was  introduced  to \nsome new projects, it felt as though everything was mechanical and there was nothing \nfor me to contribute on the creative/problem-solving side rather everything was all about \nresearch and data. I learnt a lot about research but came to know that its not my calling \nand i would rather use my brains than just copy paste stuff. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  learnt  how  to  make  attractive  presentations  and  also  learnt  to \nmake  reports.  I  must  say  I  have  studied  about  RPA  a  lot  and  it  has  surely  helped  me \nand enhanced my knowledge. \n \n \n------------"

The session was followed by 2 sessions on the working of power plant as \nin how the electricity is produced using coal and gas as fuel and how different sections \nof the power plant play their roles in the process. Afterwards we were asked to contact \nour  mentors  and  discuss  our  project  title.  After  finalizing  the  project  title  we  began  our \nresearch on the topics of the project told to us by our mentor as it was a study project \nour  main  work  was  to  go  through  a  lot  of  research  papers, articles and publications  to \nget  to  know  the  concepts  in  a  crystal  clear  manner.  My  project  title  was  ''Motor \nActuators and its Functioning\", an actuator is the mechanism by which a control system \nacts  upon  the  environment.  The  2  primary  requirements  for  the  functioning  of  an \nactuator are a control signal and a source of energy. NTPC uses over 2000 actuators in \nits   power   plant,   because   actuators   are   quite   efficient   in   providing   the   desired \nmechanical  output  for  our  input.  I  studied  the  functioning  of  Electric  Motor  Actuator  in \ndetail  because  that  is  what  my  project  was  mainly  focused  on.  Afterwards  I  studied \nvarious  concepts  which  play  a  decisive  role  in  choosing  the  desired  actuator  for  the \nmachinery. Then I went through the mechanical and electrical construction of actuators. \nThen I went through the DCS, MCC and internal feedback mechanism which are widely \nused mechanisms in the power plant. Finally I went through the design of the actuators \nproduced  by  Rotork,Auma  and  Limitorque  which  are  the  manufacturers  supplying \nactuators to NTPC, this concluded my study project in NTPC,Dadri. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  at  NTPC  has  been  very  valuable  to  me,  because \nback in college whenever I used to study the various concepts, I always used to ponder \nthat  what  applications  would  this  technique  or  this  particular  device  would  be  having, \n\n222 \n \nand how do engineers use them in a power plant, and so in order to quench my thirst I \nused to study a bit from different sources, but it happened very few times that I was able \nto  get  a  satisfactory  answer  to  my  queries  because  books  can’t  provide  you  those \nanswers  which  a  person  actually  working  in  that  industry  can,  by  his  experience,  and \npractice  school  gave  me  this  opportunity  to  listen  to  and  interact  with  people  who  are \nactually  working  in  those  power  plants.  Like  the  initial  orientation  session made  me \nrealize  what  responsibility  of  producing  power  is  shouldered  by  NTPC  and  how \nefficiently they need to produce in order to meet those demands. \nAlso,  the  mentor  assigned  to  me  is  very  encouraging  and  supportive.  He  gave  us \ninsights into how work is carried out in NTPC and his description made me realize the \nkind of work ethic that the company possess and the optimistic aura that the employees \nshare  amongst  themselves.  Also  when  we  asked  him  for  project  ideas  he  gave  us  an \noutstretched list of ideas to choose from, which was an overwhelming response for me. \nHe has been very encouraging during our project work, and is always ready to help and \nguide us.   \n \n \n \nLearning Outcome : I would like to tell that though a power plant's best experience can \nbe  gained  through  hands-on  experience,  but  pertaining  to  the  situations  it  has  been \nmanaged  in  the  best  possible  manner.  I  would  appreciate  the  practice  school  division \nfor including evaluation components like seminar and group discussion because they on \none  hand  enhanced  my  soft  skills  and on  the  other  hand  they  provided  me  an \nopportunity  to  learn  about  different  domains  of  the  power  plant(because  every  student \ngot  projects  from  different  departments)  which  I  was  missing  in  an  online  practice \nschool(as  we  were  not  physically  present  at  the  plant  to  tour  it  and  get  to  know  its \ndifferent areas). Also I would like to credit my faculty in-charge for helping us establish \ncontact  with  our  mentors  and  being  there  to  solve  any  sorts  of  queries  that  we  faced \nduring the project. \n \n \n \n------------"

The project is in the domain of Electrical Power Systems. And \nit  is  majorly  inclined  to  the  efficiency  of  motors  and  how  improve  their  efficiency  and \nsave energy. As motors are considered to be the heart of Motor Driven Systems and we \nuse  motors  for  almost  everything  thing  like  from  simplest  thing  like a  fan  to  blowers, \ncompressors and conveyer belts in industries. Over the 50% of the electricity generated \nis consumed by industries, and out of that energy  two-thirds is used by motors itself. So \nthere is a greater need in improving the efficiency of motors by reducing their losses. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was really a nice experience working with  Rajshree Cement Works, \nMalkhed. The industry mentor was very helpful. He provided me data and study material \nwhenever required. He cleared all my doubts and helped me throughout the couse. The \nproject that I was alloted to was really interesting. And everything was really nice.

The first half \nwas  mostly  spent  on  learning  these  controllers  in  depth.  I  learned  a  lot  about  them  in \nthis  period.  As  this  time,  it  was  from  virtual  mode  it  was  not  possible  to  automate  the \nplant in particular. Instead I worked upon a software which controls the working of PID \nand we can set different value of the controllers to get varying output. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  experience  with  PS-1  wasn't  great.  First,  it  was  from  the  virtual \nmode so I didn't really get the industrial exposure I was hoping for. It was quite difficult \nto work on my project as it was related to automation of the plant and it was not possible \nto do it from here. Also my mentor was quite busy so he could not give us much detail \nabout the plant and our project, although he tried his best. Still I tried to learn and work \non it as much as I can and in the end I would say that yes at least i learned something \nnew. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : My  learning  outcome  was  basically  about  the  PID  controllers.  It \nwas  a  completely  new  topic  for  me.  But  I  read  and  learned  about  it.  I  also  watched \nvideos related to its functioning in real projects. I learned about its working and how to \ntune  it. I  learned  to  set  different  values  of  the  constants  in  the  controller  to  get  the \ndesired result as per the requirement of the PID. I wished I could have been to the plant \n\n239 \n \nphysically, then I am sure I would have learned a lot more and would have a far better \nexperience of PS-1 than what I had now. \n \n \n------------"

We initially used Ricardo WAVE \nsoftware  to  first  get  Base-Line  values  and  then  tabulated  and  re-used  these  values  in \nSimulink to do a second and final simulation because simulating using Ricardo WAVE is \nvery time consuming. The final step was be to prepare efficiency island plots using the \ntabulated  data  thereby  finding  the  optimum  points  of  the  parameters  considered.  By \ndoing  so,  we  were  able  to  understand  how  emissions  vary  with  various  calibration \nparameters  and  thereby  calibrate  the  given  engine to  get  the  best  performance  while \nsimultaneously following the emission norms. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: The project we have been working on has helped us gain significant \nknowledge  in  the field  of  automobiles  and has  provided  a  valuable  experience beyond \nthe  classroom  setting  by  academically  being  engaged  in  a  project  identified  from  the \nindustry.

To  generate  its  cognates,  i.e,  mechanisms  that \ngenerate  the  very  same  coupler  curve,  we  use  Roberts-Chebychev  theorem  which \nstates  that  there  exists  two  cognates  of any  four  bar  coupler  linkage. We also  use  the \nCayley diagram to generate the cognates. Finally we verify the input/ output conditions \nthrough  Grashof  law.

As  we  know,  India's  economy  is  still  dependent  on  agriculture,  with \nmore  than  20% of  the  those  who  are  engaged  in  this  sector  are  marginal  farmers. \nSurviving as a marginal farmer is very difficult in India. Increasing number of farmers are \ncommitting  suicides  in  India  and  the  pressure  to  support  the  agricultural  economy  is \nincreasing for the Government of India. India’s farmers are increasingly feeling ignored \nby  the  government for  the  middle  class.  During  the  release  of  the 20  lakh  crore  rupee \nstimulus  package  by  finance  minister  Nirmala  Sitaraman,  GoI  announced  agricultural \nreforms  to  assure  a  minimum  price  for  the  farmers. Government  also  changed  the \nAPMC act to reform the current bias ridden system. \nThe  department  of  agriculture, Government  of  Goa  devised  a  project  to  build  a  B2B \nplatform  for  farmers  and  traders  of Goa  to  decrease  the  role  of middlemen  and  to \nincrease the farmers’ income. They have sought the ideas of the youth for technology \nintegration  and  the  improvement  of  livelihood  of  farmers.  Consultation  with  the  nodal \nofficer of DoA, Goa revealed to us the fact that Goa is the richest state of India and that \nthe  production  cost  for  farmers  there  is  very  high  as  compared  to  other  parts  of  the \ncountry. They have assigned us with the task of developing and initiating a ‘Pilot Project’ \nto  implement  the  government's  new  policies. Here, We, a  group  of  BITS Pilani \nUniversity students are helping them in their initiative. \nUnder  the  guidance  of  our  PS-I faculty  and  the  Nodal  officer  of  the  Department  of \nAgriculture, Goa, We have planned a mobile app for farmers and a web app for traders \nwith   different   functionalities.   The   research   and   information   about   the   relevant \nstakeholders,  the  proposed  functionality  of  the    agriculture  marketplace and  its  pricing \nmethodology. In this regard, We have developed the web app and mobile applications. \nWe took their advice and then learnt technical skills required for the project. Then, We \nbuilt basic working model for both web app and mobile app on android platform. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  very  good  dealing  with  government  to  help  them  for  the \nbetterment  of  the  society. Even  facing  connectivity  issues and  full  work  from  mode, it \nwas very much fun interacting with group members regarding the project. \n \n \nLearning outcome: How to engage with government bodies to help them serve better \nto the people of India. Group discussions and brainstorming sessions with government \nbodies  to  create  B2B  portal  for  farmers  and  traders  by  creating  web  app  and  mobile \napp. \n\n19 \n \n \n \n------------"

Team  office  is  situated  in    IIT \nHyderabad. The basic idea of Donatekart is get those NGO'S, private organisations or \nindividual  personalities  onboard  who  have  some  compelling  stories, to  which  a  donar \nwould  like  to  donate  as  soon  as  they  read  or  see  videos  related.They  work  for  a  wide \nrange of causes and some of their present campaigns targets on life of migrant workers \nwhich  are  hit  badly  due  to  COVID-19.  Another  popular  campaign on  there  website  is \nrelated  to  transgender  community  and  Coal  miners  also.  With  a  high  number  of \nsuccessful  campaigns  and  stories,  the  company  has  been  able  to  find  a  respectable \n\n22 \n \nposition  in  social sector industry  and  has  gained  attention  as  well  as  recognition  from \nvarious sources. \nThe work which I was allotted, is to find stories which could go on Donatekart platform \nand  should  be  related  to  non-COVID  causes, using  various  online  websites,  blogs, \nnewspapers and  various  other  sources.  At  this  moment, I have  contributed  as  high  as \n15 stories,  which they will further contact with help of there marketing team. \nThe  work  was  surely  associated  with  some of  the  real  life  problems  a  company  faces, \nas  in  order  to  find  the  articular  clients  was  a  difficult  task, as  many  big  NGO'S  or \ncompanies were  already  linked  with  them and  the  ones  which  we  could  find  were  not \nhaving  proper  websites  or  web  presence  and  hence  commenting  on  there  truthiness \nwas  a  really  difficult  task,  to  this  our  PS-I instructor  came  as  a  rescue  as  he  way \noptimistic and helped in every way to overcome our difficulties. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  had  a  very  good  experience  working  with  Donatekart,  if  given a \nchance  I  will  be  surely  available  to  work  them  once  again.

The  project  domain  was  market  research  and \nthe topic was-Mapping healthcare and reimbursement systems in selected geographies. \nWe  were  given  a  set  of  countries  and  we  had  to  study  them  based  on  certain \nparameters  like  GDP,  health  expenditure, insurance  policies,  oncology  sales,  drug \nmarket  scenario,  etc. Our  main focus  was  cancer  landscape  in  a  particular  country.  In \nthe  end,  we  presented  our  research  in  the  form  of  a  report  to  the  mentor  and  other \ncompany officials so that the company might take an informed decision regarding future \ninvestments. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  project  domain  was  outside  our  academic  curriculum  since, it \ninvolved  market  research.  Initially,  we  were  facing  some  difficulties  in  gathering  and \nassembling  data  since  much  information  was  not  available  on  open  source  platforms \nbut our mentor was really helpful in guiding us with the project and giving us necessary \nfeedback  about  our  research.  Our  instructor  was  regular  with  the  meets  and  grading \n\n32 \n \nwas  a  bit  strict  in  the  beginning  but  the  instructor  helped  us  to  move  in  the  right \ndirection.  Overall, I  would  say  students  who  are  interested  in  finance  and  market \nanalysis  should  take  up  this  station  as  it  required  us  to  assess  the  market.  Pharmacy \nstudents can also take up this course as it will help you to understand the drug pricing \nmechanisms  and  health  funding  in  different  companies  which  will  surely  help  you  in \nfuture. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: Since, the  project  domain  was  something  new  we  had  to  do,  the \nwork  was  a  bit  over  whelming  but  I  gained  an  insight  into  the  healthcare  models  and \npolicies adopted in other countries. I also learnt  more about the software tools like MS \nExcel. I also learnt how to filter the enormous amount of data on the internet and how to \ntabulate your results in short concise and meaningful manner. In conclusion, I would say \nthat  this  project  improved  my  ability  to  critically  analyse  things  and  improved  my \ncommunication skills (like report writing and e-mail writing) as well. \n \n \n------------"

We  had  to  make  a  comprehensive  report  about  the \nvarious  infections,  its  treatments  available,  pathology  and  other  details.  We  mostly \nreferred to the guidlines set by the WHO and also did a lot of background research on \nvarious topics pertaining to the project. It was an interesting project as we got our first \ntaste  at scientific  writing. We  made  a  report  that  contains basic  information  about \nHIV/AIDS and detailed information about the infections. \n \n \nPS-I   experience: Our   experience   was   very   fruitful.

It   is   designed   to   minimize   the   risks involved   in   any   pharmaceutical \nproduction  that  cannot  be  eliminated  through  testing  the  final  product.  This  project  is \nintended to   provide   guidance   regarding GMP   for   the   manufacturing   of   active \npharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under an appropriate system for managing quality. It \nis also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the quality and purity characteristics that \nthey  possess.  The  main  objective  of  this  project  is  learning  to  establish  a  good  QMS \n(Quality  Management  system).  And  in  order  to  understand QMS  it  is  very  essential  to \nunderstand GMP. Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical \nIngredients,  Guidance  for  Industry  helps  us  to  know  about  all  the  essential  tools  to \nunderstand  GMP.  After  understanding  this, it  would  give  awareness  of  Quality  & \nProduction responsibility to set QMS. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Throughout the 6 weeks of my PS-1 station, I was constantly in touch \nwith  both  PS  FACULTY:  Dr.  S.  Murugesan  and  PS  MENTOR:  MR.  Bimal  B.Pandya \nboth helped me a lot  to understand my project domain. They  always encouraged my \n\n65 \n \nqueries and doubts related to the project. This project not only helped me to understand \nICH  Q7  guidelines,  GMP  &  QMS  but  also  helped  me  to  explore  other  domains  in  the \npharmaceutical industry. We also had discussion regarding scope of pharmacy, stability \nstudies, clinical  trials, automation  and  many  other  topics.Though, it  was a  work  from \nhome  internship,  learning  was  never  compromised.  Even  in  this  distant  mode  of \ncommunication, this PS gave me an opportunity of not only expanding my thinking but \nalso  finding  solutions  beyond  the  scope  of  this  PS  project.  My  PS  station  had  a  very \nmotivating, encouraging and positive environment. It was a great work experience.  \n \n \nLearning outcome: 1. Background and Introduction.  \na) The main objective of this project is learning to establish a good QMS. And in order to \nunderstand QMS, it is very essential to understand GMP. \nb)  Understanding  of  ICH  Q7  will  help  me  to  understand  all  the essential  tools  to \nestablish QMS. \nc) Here Quality Unit plays an important role. Understanding the role of QA & QC helps \nus to know the working of API manufacturing plant. \nd) Understanding all other domains such as Material Management, Lab control records \nand other major topics in ICH Q7 guidelines is very important. \n2.  Literature  Review - Understanding  all  sections  and  sub-sections  of  Q7  Good \nManufacturing  Practice Guidance  for  Active  Pharmaceutical  Ingredients,  Guidance  for \nIndustry. \n3. Identifying the research gaps - I have understood the major objective of this project, \nthe major gap I figured out is how to understand the whole process taking the example \nof  a  single  API.  Like  for  example  if  I  pick  a  drug  X ,  what  is  the  role  of  QA,  QC, \nproduction  unit,  etc.  from  its  procurement  to  its  manufacturing  and  release  of  final \nproduct. Flow chart for batch plan and dispatching the material were discussed in order \nto understand this gap. \n4. Conclusion \n1. ICH Q7 is very important in maintaining quality of the API.  \n2. API manufacturer can improve output of the manufacturing process.  \n3. Helps to enhance productivity as well as effectiveness of the manufacturing process.  \n4. ICH Q7 ensures less batch to batch variations and less chance of recalls.  \n5. Following this guideline can also help during regulatory inspections.  \n6. By understanding GMP we would be able to understand and establish QMS. \n \n \n------------"

Since, the  station  is  a  hospital,  there  isn't \nmuch  technical  support  they  could  provide.  So,  we  have  to  learn  everything  ourselves \nand with the help of modules uploaded in canvas. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: I learnt  the basic front end and  the  back  end  in  app  development \nand could build professional communication skills too. \n \n \n------------"
