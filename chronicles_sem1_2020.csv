"","SANYAM JAIN","2017A7PS0014P","Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: We first need to identify the collections from which\nwe need to extract data from the MongoDB database. Then, queries are written using aggregate\npipeline in Mongo compass, and the desired code for the flask app is taken. The aggregation\npipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing\npipelines.   Documents   enter   a   multi-stage   pipeline   that   transforms   the   documents   into\naggregated results. Then, APIs are created in the flask framework using those previously written\nqueries and then tested in Postman. API testing is used to determine whether the output is well-\nstructured and useful to another application or not, checks the response on basis of input\n(request) parameter, and checks how much time the API is taking to retrieve and authorize the\ndata too. In this way, we finally get the working APIs which can directly be used in Angular using\nHTTP requests. Here, while working with the APIs, it's the choice of the developer either to write\nless APIs and take most of the desired data (this way will require more operations in the\nfrontend to filter the data) or to write a greater number of APIs and take specific data (in this\ncase, developer don’t need to make many efforts in frontend). Now, we use the APIs developed\nin backend using HTTP requests and perform several operations on data as per need. As\nscreen requirements are shared with us before development, we first identify the materials used\n262\n\nand then write logic for each section. We used “Angular Materials” for all the statements to\nmaintain   consistency   and   better   configuration   options.

"Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam ","SUBHRATAVA MANDAL","2017A3PS0415G","Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: Question / project description: - Fast breeder test\nreactor (FBTR) is 40 MW nuclear reactor situated in Kalpakkam. Nuclear heat generated in the\nreactor core due to fission is extracted using liquid sodium as coolant. FBTR is loop type\nreactor, which has two primary loops to exchange the heat to secondary sodium system.\nFurther, heat in secondary sodium system is transferred to steam water system to generate\nelectricity. The heat generated inside the core is distributed equally to two primary loops. Each\nloop has a heat exchanger and sodium pump. After exchanging the heat to secondary sodium in\nthe heat exchangers in each loop sodium in both the loops is passed through a common inlet\npipe into the reactor vessel. Over flow tank collects the excess sodium in reactor vessel, and\nthrough EM pump part of the sodium is passed through a sodium purification circuit. Sodium\nreturn to reactor vessel after purification. Over flow tank plays important role in the maintenance\nof sodium level in RV. The decrease in sodium level in OFT is one of the indirect indications of\nleak in primary sodium loop. Hence, OFT sodium level discordance alarm is provided in main\ncontrol room to alert the operator, in case of change in the level of OFT. Presently, the alarm\nset-point is manually set by the operator in control station after OFT level stabilizes. However,\nOFT   also   changes   during   normal   process.   Since,   the   capacities   of   primary   loops   are\ninterconnected, with increase in sodium temperature, sodium volume also increases and hence\nthe level in various capacities and hence, it reflects an increase in sodium level in OFT. So, the\noperator has to frequently change or set the discordance alarm threshold during genuine\nprocess changes. Due to which it may happen that alarm due to actual leak may get masked\nduring process transients. Hence, it is required to have automatic set-point tracker to ensure\nthat set-point is automatically “tracked” following the OFT level in case of genuine process\nchanges. The project is to design and develop an automatic set-point tracker, which includes\nsignal conditioning of temperature signal, analyzing of data (sodium level vs temperature) and\nderiving relationship between the changes in OFT sodium level and changes in temperature and\nsuitably changing the set-point.\n280\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Python3, MATLAB.\nObjectives of the project: Automatic OFT level discordance setpoint tracker.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Got   experience   in   real   world   problems,   apply   knowledge   in\nindustrial process.\nDetails of papers / patents: Nil\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Work from\nhome environment.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: None"

I majorly used Python\nand associated libraries.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Development - Spring Boot, Java, Apache Maven,\nAngular, HTML, CSS, Typescript, MongoDB.\nMachine Learning - Python, Statsmodels, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit.\nAutomation - Python, Selenium, Pandas, Pywinauto, Pywin32, UIPath.\nObjectives of the project: 1. To ideate and implement a full-stack web portal to be used as\nproject tracker, storage and distribution hub for internal workings in TR 2. To ideate and\nimplement a time-series forecasting model to forecast monthly expenses in various business\nunits.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Time-series   forecasting,   full-stack   development,   end-to-end\ndevelopment project ideation and implementation, automation.\nDetails of papers / patents: None\nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company:   The\nenvironment at TR is great, and everyone is supportive. One is given complete freedom to what\nhe / she wants to do to design solution approach for the given problem and implement it. I got a\nchance to interact and work with many cross-functional teams throughout my tenure, who\nworked at different places, like Bangalore, US, UK, under different domains, like accountancy,\nsales, technical, and people from upper management. The team is supportive of limitations and\npeople are willing to help. So, the exposure is great. The expectations that I experienced was\nthat I always had the option to specify my own deadlines, but it is expected of me to not exceed\nit. Working hours are friendly and there is always a flexibility to adjust it as per your need if one\ncan meet their commitment. However, one is expected to be available for all discussions and\nmeetings, whenever they are scheduled to be. But majority of the projects in the team are\nautomation based and so if someone wants to do different things (like development, ML), they\nhave to make efforts to get such a project in the bag and commit to deliver it. One is also\nexpected to self-learn and apply. Apart from automation, as the team is getting new into ML and\ndevelopment, there will not be much technical help around. All in all, I would summarize by\n579\n\nsaying that it is good option to have if someone is looking for just a good overall internship\nexperience only.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object oriented programming, Neural networks\nand Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Database systems."

"","MEHTA IRISH HARESH","2017AAPS0295G","Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: I was in the DRAUP team within Zinnov and my\nprojects were mainly in the braindesk department, where we created reports and slide decks for\nclients. The work was mainly oriented towards talent analysis based on various parameters and\n681\n\nreskilling presentations based on DRAUP platform database as well as secondary research.\nTalent analysis here means quantitative things like average salaries of a certain job role,\nnumber of employees in a certain role at a certain location, etc. Reskilling analysis here\ndescribes the skills required for certain roles and how to gain those skills (courses, learning\npaths, etc.).\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): DRAUP platform, secondary research, Excel,\nPowerpoint.\nObjectives of the project: I worked on a total of 4 projects, 3 of them dealing with reskilling\nanalysis and the remaining one dealing with location specific talent analysis. Talent analysis\ngenerally deals with assisting clients in hiring strategies or branch creation.\nMajor learning outcomes: I mainly learnt about Guesstimates, secondary research, talent\nanalysis,   organizational   structures,   job   description   analysis,   making   customer-friendly\npresentations,   internal   stakeholder   engagement,   high-pressure   work   environment.   Another\nmajor learning outcome was that consultants within DRAUP have to engage with clients on a\ndaily basis, and sometimes interns too, hence soft / behavioural skills are extremely important\nfor this role. The ability to work for long hours is also a prerequisite here.\nDetails of papers / patents: None\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Unfortunately,\nthe entire internship was WFH, so interaction with office staff was limited only to work and there\nwas practically no relationship building. However, as far as work is considered, it's extremely\nhigh pressure and interns have to do a lot of work, sometimes as interesting as running models\nfor generating location specific talent data and making guesstimates and sometimes as boring\nas excel data entry. If someone is interested in consulting, the braindesk team within DRAUP\nprovides   a   great   learning   curve,   however,   the   working   hours   exceed   7   hours   daily   and\nsometimes extend till 12 / 13 hours too.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: EPS, TRW.\n682\n"
