In our first project,\nwe first tried finding defocus map using basic image processing techniques such as edge\n41\n\ndetection using Sobel operator and Laplacian operator continued with some advanced image\nprocessing techniques such as canny edge detector. Since plain edge detection techniques are\nnot giving good results, we turned to machine learning models such as holistic edge detector.\nEdge detectors are giving good results when the defocused part of the image has very less\nvariation in intensities. As we know that this will not be the case for every image, we want to find\ndefocus map by finding the function/ kernel that is causing the defocus. And also, we are using\nsome deep learning models ( advanced models of CNNs) to find the defocus map. For the\nsecond project, we built a crop tool that automatically crops an image with the user given aspect\nratio while maintaining the image composition and aesthetics. We combined a neural network\narchitecture and an optimisation module to maintain the image composition and aesthetics. This\ntool is designed to combine with export workflow of LrClassic so that it would significantly\ndecrease the time spent by user while exporting batches of images\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Jupyter Notebook, Lightroom, SQLite,Plotly\nObjectives of the project : Object Homogeneous Defocus Map Estimation and Automatic Crop\nfor Export Workflow\nMajor Learning Outcomes : I had to explore different architectures for the model to recognize\nthe region of interest and experiment on it.

They design and develop new shocks depending upon the customer\n(most of the OEMs). In development process, prorotypes were built and tested to make sure all\nthe customer requirements are statisfied. These prototypes were built in a way such that sub-\nassemblies   can   be   varied   for   producing   desirable   Damping   force   in   the   damper   (Shock\nabsorber). Piston sub-assembly is one of such sub-assemblies. In Piston sub-assembly, valve\nstacks will be located on both sides. These are made up of shim discs, orifice discs.\nIn development process, during testing phase, Damping force is generated by varying valve\nstacks, etc... that too in trail and error fashion. Because of this time taken to fine tune damper\nwill be long. To reduce this time taking process, they initiated an application such that damping\nforce can be generated for a given set of valve stack properties with a fixed shock absorber\noutline.\nIn this application,\nStage-I :\nIndentification deflection of valve stack with respective to velocity of piston rod in damper.\nStage-II :\nKeeping deflection of stack as input, Stiffness of the stack can be calculated\nStage-III:\nNote: Damping force is nothing but resisting force offered by shim stack to oil flowing from one \nchamber to another chamber.\nKeeping stiffness as input, Damping force is calculated. A trend is generated for Damping force \nvs Velocity of piston rod.\nThis prediction of Damping force w.r.t. velocity of piston will make the NPD (new Product \nDevelopment) team take less time for appropriate valve stack.\nWe developed a MATLAB GUI with references from Ansys fluent work, which will predict the \ndeflection of the stack.\n156\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : MATLAB, Ansys (Structural & Fluent), Excel \nsheets, CATIA V5\nObjectives of the project : Prediction of deflection of pyramid shim stack\nMajor Learning Outcomes : 1.
