            "writeUp": "Student Write-up  \n \nShort  Summary  of  work  done : The  company  was  working  on  a  asset  project,  i.e., \ndeveloping an ERP portal, to combine all the micro-services being developed. This was \nbeing  done  keeping  in  mind  the  company's  plans  to  grow  to  a  larger  scale,  and  thus, \nautomating the work which is currently manual was crucial. The tasks such as collecting \ncustomer,  employee  and  project  data,  allotting  projects  to  employees,  billing  the \n\n12 \n \ncustomers, maintaining employee schedules, etc. are some of the micro-services. I was \nallotted in the team working on Back-end services. I was involved in creating, modifying \nand  testing  APIs  for  various  micro-services.  Based  on  a  few  APIs  already  existing, \nwhich I studied, I created binding tables and APIs to handle the data coming from Front-\nend services. Since Front-end development was being done simultaneously, we had to \nuse  dummy  data  to  test  our  APIs.  We  worked  Python,  PostgreSQL  and  Postman  to \nwrite and test our code. The APIs involved CRUD operations, and I created APIs which \ninvolved Get, Post and Patch request. The project is in development, and will continue \nto be worked upon, after my PSI ends. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-I  experience  can  be  divided  into  three  parts - first  one  being \nlearning   new   languages   and   tutorials,   second   being completing   tasks   in   web \ndevelopment,  and  last  being  getting  started  with  competitive  coding.  The  first  three \nweeks were spent on learning new languages and topics from tutorials provided by the \nmentors.  I  learnt  the  basics  of  Python,  C++,  PostgreSQL,  Git, Flask,  etc.  This  helped \nme  understand  the  requirement  and  utility  of  each  one  in  the  project.  The  next  three \nweeks I was given tasks on the ERP project which involved working with APIs. Although \nI  struggled  with  this  part,  I  am  happy  for  the  experience  I  gained on  these  topics. The \nlast two weeks, I started problem solving on online platforms to build my logical thinking \nskills  and  speed  up my  implementation  skills.  I  got  into  competitive  coding  because  of \nthe Hackathon culture in my PS station and the other students from BITS. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt a lot of things, from how an organization functions to how \nteams  co-ordinate  on  projects.  I  studied  various  new  languages  and  topics,  which  will \nbe of great help in my future courses and projects. \n \n \nPS-I is  an  exposure  oriented  course : I  completely  agree  with  this  statement.  From \nmy  experience,  I  have  spent  more  time  learning  new  things  than  working  on  tasks, \nwhich I think was a conscious effort from the employees as well \n \n------------"

For  this  purpose  various  tools \nsuch  as  Openlayers  ,PostgreSQL  ,  GeoServer  ,  JavaScript,  PostGIS  ,  along  with \nmultiple data formats including PostGIS database and GeoJSON have been used. This \nproject  also  uses  various  web  rendering  services  such  as  Web  Map  Services(WMS) \nand Web Feature Services(WFS).After the rendering procedure is done, the clipping out \nof features in the map is done using Cassandra Query Language (CQL) filters. \n2nd part of the project \nWhile working with maps, it is a common requirement of having the capability to find out \nthe  shortest distance between two points or to be precise the source and destination . \nWhile    getting  the  normal Euclidian  distance  is  quite  easy  and  straightforward,  the \ncomplications  arise when there exists restrictions on the kind of route or road network \nthat has to be followed definitely .This project  \naims on finding : \n1)Shortest distance between source and destination. \n2)Shortest distance between source and destination when a list of middle points or halt \npoints  are specified that must be covered in the travelled path. \nFor   this   purpose,various   tools   have   been   used   such   as   PgAdmin4,PostgreSQL, \nPostGis, and PgRouting .

The project we have undertaken is in the realm \nof examinations, for the Public Service Commission and Department of Education. This \nwas  a  Full  Stack  Web  Development  project,  completely  Free  and  Open  Source \nSoftware  and  ideally  extensible  to  all  departments  of  the  Kerala  Government.  Our \nproject   dealt   with   the   issue   of   Hall   Ticket   Malpractice   and   Impersonation   in \nexaminations, so we designed a software application that digitizes and streamlines the \nprocess of Hall Ticket Verification and Authentication using Biometric Data. \nThe project comprised of two parts. The first part (Level 1) was to update the biometric \ndetails of the candidate (fingerprints) and store that data in a database. The web page \ndesigned  for  this  purpose  would  first  verify  the  student  and  their  details based  on  roll \nnumber provided and then allow them to add a new photo and five fingerprints from any \none hand. The second part (Level 2) was to verify the student in any further iterations of \nthe  same  exam or  even for  college  admissions  if  required. The  web page  built for  this \nwould also take in the roll number provided and print out the details stored before. Then, \nthe candidate would need to present one of their fingers to verify their identity. \nThe  scope  of  this  project  extends  to  all  examinations  being  conducted  by  any \norganisation,  it  needs  simple  user  requirements  and  is  a  secure  application.  There  is \nroom  for  improvement  to  make  the  whole  process  automated,  but  for  now,  we  require \nhuman resources. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Since it was founded in 1988, CDIT is the only State run organisation \nin  India  to have  obtained  the  necessary  qualifications to have  an  in  house  Holography \nDivision.  It  will  also  be  one  of  the  first  non-corporate  organisations  to  have  the \ncredentials to serve independent clients in Full Stack Web Development. CDIT places a \nfocus  on  work  ethic  and  practical,  attainable  goals  that  has  enabled  us  to  understand \nhow an effective workplace pushes employees to do their best.  \nAt  our  PS  station  we  were  given  exposure  to  the  corporate  industry  as  well as  team \nmanagement aspects of a project. Continuous review and discussion meets and group \ndiscussions  helped  us  bond  as  a  team  and  work  as  a  collective  force.  Working  in  an \nindustrial  environment  helped  us  learn  and  implement  different  technical  terms  and \nprocesses   like   Software   Development   Life   Cycle   (SDLC),   Software   Requirement \nSpecifications   (SRS)   and   User   Requirement   Document   (URD).   Our   internship \nintroduced  us  to  new  tools  and  software  like  IBM  AppScan,  Node.JS,  and  Sequelize \nand also gave us a better understanding of our skill sets and associated career options \nand  opportunities.  We  had  constant  support  of  our  PS  coordinators,  Mr.  Rayson  Alex \n\n22 \n \nand  Mr.  Deepu  Dileep,  our  station  coordinator,  Mr.  N.  Jayaraj  and  mentor,  Mr.  Shibu \nManikkoth who were always ready to help and solve our problems. \n \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : During  our  internship  at  CDIT,  we  were  able  to  learn  about  the \ntechnical as well as non technical aspects of working under a project. Working together \nunder the project helped us build teamwork. Each one of us were allocated tasks based \non  topics  we  were  individually  comfortable  with.This  helped  in  the  smooth  progress  of \nour project. Moreover we were also able to learn topics we weren't familiar with from our \nteam members. \nComing  to  the  technical  aspects,  we  were  introduced  to  Software  Development  Life \nCycle which is a set of guidelines for a Software Development team on how to provide \neffective software solutions. We were given a brief session and demonstration on what \nare the various levels of testing undergone by a software before it is officially released. \nWe  were  given  a  demo  on  IBM  AppScan,  a  security  testing  tool.  We  also  visited  the \nCDIT Optical Image Processing unit, where we had a session on Hologram production. \nAs  part  of  our  project,  we  learned  to  use  front-end  tools  like  HTML,  CSS  Bootstrap, \nJavaScript  as  well  as  backend  tools  like  Node.JS.  We  also  learned  to  use  a  MySQL \ndatabase  and  connected  it  to  the  backend  using  the  Sequelize  Object-Relational \nMapping Framework. We also learned to integrate external input devices like Fingerprint \nScanners and Barcode Scanners to our web application. \nFrom  our  mentors  at  CDIT,  we  also  were  able  to  learn  several  soft  skills  such  as \nworking  in  a  team  and  managing  time  and  deadlines.  The  amount  of  freedom and \ncontrol they gave us over our project helped us achieve a realistic Software Application. \n \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course : Back  in  college  we  approached  any  problem \nwith  only  a  single  motive  of achieving  the  required  functionality  without worrying  about \ncode maintainability,  load  and  other  complexities.  After  getting  an  exposure  to  real  life \nproblems  through  this  internship,  we  realised  how  complex  building  and  maintaining  a \nsoftware can be. Also in college we were never worried about questions like “How many \nusers are going to use the software?”, “How much data will be processed?”, “What are \nthe expected response times for a function?”. Our college projects were usually short-\nsighted.   In   real-world   projects   though,   the   above   questions   fundamentally   affect \ndecisions   about   hardware,   technologies/tools   to   be   used,   system   architecture, \nalgorithms, and so on. We were exposed to different technicalities, processes and units \ninvolved in a project. Working in a team helped us realise the importance of teamwork, \ngroup discussions and review meets. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n23"

It further \ninvolves creating a custom API service to provide a backend for the chatbot to get data \nfrom and then integrate the chatbot with twitter. For the machine learning and NLU, we \nhave used the cloud based service by Google called DialogFlow. This is a software that \nhelps  in  making  chatbots  by  allowing  developers  to  set  different  intents  and  hence \ndifferent ways to interpret the entered data by the user and then classify information into \nsome basic variable called entities. The identification of intents and entities then allows \nthe  developers  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  user  in  the  form  of  response  by  the \nchatbot.  The  API  service  we  created  was  a  restful  API  service  based  on  Jersey.  The \nfunction receives the request from dialogflow in the form of JSON file. The backend java \nconverts  JSON  into  java  classes.  The  parameters  received  are  stored  in  the  form  of \nvariables in java. The parameters are used to query, using SQL in java and then store \nresults  again  in  the form  of  java  class  objects.  These  objects  are again  converted  into \nJSON and sent back to dialogflow. For fetching data from database we created the java \ncode  which  fires  SQL  queries  to fulfil user requests. The variable “period” stores the \ntime period user wants earning for. The “commodity” variable stores the commodity user \nwants earning about. Then we fire query in SQL \n \n \nPS-I  experience: PS-1  at  CRIS  was  a  great  experience  for  all parties  invloved.

In Loopback 3, models were responsible for accessing data as well as in \nproviding application’s REST API. This poses a difficulty in  \ncustomizing REST API for customers. The division of LoopBack model’s responsibilities \ninto  Controllers,  Repositories,  Models  and  Services  helps  in  tackling  this  problem. \nLoopback  3  uses  callback  function  for  asynchronous  programming.  This  creates \nproblems  for  programmers  while  chaining  functions  as  callback involves  nested  loops. \nLoopBack  4  tackles  this  issue  of  clean  and  readable  code  by  using  Async/Await  and \nPromise. LoopBack 3 uses JavaScript which creates problem for programmers to write \nclean object-oriented code . Loopback 4 is a solution to this problem as it uses object-\noriented  Typescript  language. The  current  Loopback  3  based  codebase  pose  problem \nin  terms  of  clean,  readable  code  and  customizing  REST  APIs  for  the  programmers. \nTherefore, the primary aim of our project is to migrate this codebase into LoopBack 4.  \nHero  (Healthcare  for  Entire  Railway  Organization)  portal  has  a  3  layered  architecture \nwith database setup in PostgreSQL, middleware in Loopback 3 and frontend in Ionic 4. \nWe as a team had to work on middleware for the portal and were supposed to migrate \nthe  Loopback  codebase.  The  project  has  given  us  a  lot  of  insight  into  the  process  of \nRESTful  APIs  development  and  how  LoopBack  as  a  tool  provides  power  to  easily \ncreate powerful APIs. The project resulted in developing a proper migration strategy for \nHERO codebase. This will save a lot of time for the professionals that will be working on \nthe migration strategy  at a future date. The new updated Loopback 4 based codebase \nwill help in easy maintenance of codebase and will help in developing powerful features \nfor the API. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: practical  skills,  workplace  experience  and  greater  knowledge  of  that \nindustry \n \n \nLearning Outcome : New and improved skills and how to apply them.  \nProfessional communications. \nNetworking is important.  \nTaking constructive criticism well.  \nWork hard no matter what you're doing.  \nIndependence.  \nMaking connections. \n \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course : I absolutely agree \n \n------------ \n\n26"

I  learned \nabout  Mean  Average  Precision,  Discounted  Cumulative  Gain,  and  terms  associated \nwith them like Recall, Precision etc.  I had to implement Discounted Cumulative Gain on \nthe data given to me. I had to create certain files with a particular Schema to feed into \nthe  dashboard  to  visualize  the  results.  My  second  task  was  to  learn  about  Topic \nmodelling.  It  seemed  like  a  very  interesting  and  useful  model.  I  began  by  looking  at \nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It could discover hidden features about the documents \nand then we could try and group them based on the topic distribution of the documents. \nWe don't  need  to  explicitly  name  the  topics, they  can  be  abstract.  The most  important \npart  was  to  clean  the  text.  It  involved  operations  such  as  tokenizing,  stemming, \nlemmatizing,  splitting  words,  n-grams  and  spelling  corrections.  The  order  of  all  these \nhad  to  be  chosen  carefully.  After  running  this  through  a  vectorizer,  it was  finally  ready \nfor  the  actual  LDA  algorithm.  I  had  to  use  Grid  Search  to  decide  hyper  parameters.  I \nalso   ran   K-Means   clustering   to   cluster   the   documents   after   we   got   their   topic \ndistribution.Along  the  way  I  learnt  basic  table  operations  like  joins,  pivoting,  melting, \nsorting, group by, etc,. \n \n \nPS-I experience: My PS-1 experiences was one of the best ones so far. Since this was \nmy  first  internship  I  was  looking  forward  to  it.  I  was  very  keen  to  observe  how  people \n\n35 \n \noperate and communicate in an organisation, and how different pieces of work done by \ndifferent employees all comes together to become a part something bigger and whole. \nMeeting new people from other colleges was a very nice feeling as well. The employees \nwere  very  helpful  and  kind  and  they  would  guide  us  whenever  we  needed  them. \nEverything, from the people, the work and the office, was wonderful here. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : I  wasn't  a  coding  geek,  neither  did  I  know  many  languages,  but \nthat  was  okay,  because  the  idea  was  not  to  learn  any  particular language,  but  being \nable to implement algorithms/logic through any one of them. Since, I wasn't very fluent \nin Python, it was a great opportunity for me to learn about Python's usability, it's ability \nto  do  so  much  in  such  little  line  of  code.  From  generator  expressions,  to  its  various \navailable   libraries   and   their   functionalities,   they   never   ceased   to   amaze   me.   I \nencountered a few hiccups in beginning and had to look up the errors a lot of times to \nsee if there were other people like me (and most importantly to immediately jump at the \nsolutions  to  the  errors  posted  on  different  websites).  But  in  the  end,  when  the  code \nfinally  did  what  I  wanted  it  to  ,  it  was  all  well  and  good.For  the first  time  I  could  see  a \n(relatively) modern machine struggling to produce an output, that otherwise, I reckoned, \nwould only take a few seconds. This made me understand the importance of optimizing \nthe  code  and  the  need  for  faster  hardware.This  also  gave  me  an  idea  about  the \nvastness of data that people work with. \n \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course : Yes, PS-1 is an exposure oriented course. We \ncan learn so much from just interacting with people who are working around us. We can \nlearn  new  trends  and  new  algorithms  and  technologies  that  are  coming  up.  We  can \nunderstand  the  problems  faced  in  implementing  certain  things,  and  why  we  choose  to \nproceed one way rather than another. We get to know the challenges involved only if we \nare  exposed  to  the  real  world  and  we  can  then  figure  out  how  to  overcome  the \nchallenge. \n \n------------"

The next 28 days were mostly completing the problem statements. We \nhad  to  deliver  an  end-to-end  solution  for  them  which  included  a  basic  front-end  part \n(angular),    a  back-end  part  (Python),  the  DB  (MongoDB).  The  company  works  in  the \neducational  sector  where  they  make  ERP  products  for  their  clients  (clients  being \neducation institutes) which includes - academics module, administration module, and an \naccreditation readiness module. The work we did was related to the NBA accreditation \nmodule where we help our clients by adding basic visualizations to the clients' own data \nfor  a  few  areas  in  the  NBA  accreditation  document  so  they  can  learn  and  improve \nwherever required. \nThe first  set  of  problems  will  take  some  time  as  you  will  have  to  work around  with  the \ndatabase, figure out stuff that you did not need during the training period, but the set of \nproblems after that will be a little swifter and easier as you would have a decent idea of \nwhat  you  need  to  deliver.

The  tech-leads  technical  expertise  was  very  helpful  and  guided  us \nthroughout our time there. But, you have to be ready to work from 9 to 6, M to F. Some \ntimes  when  there  is  a  lot  of  work  left,  we  were  also  asked  to  work  after  hours  and  on \nweekends  by  ourselves  to  catch  up  with the  timetable  that  had  been  set  for  us.

STEMGames  was  conceived  with  the  idea \nof  an  experiential  pedagogy  towards  science  education,  backed  by  the  ideals  and \nexperience of Dr. Nagarjuna in the same field. STEMGames seeks to inculcate \"STEM \nhabits\"  and  a  lasting  avidity  for  scientific  knowledge  while  achieving  meaningful \ncreations  made  by  the  participants  themselves.  The  plugin,  in  its  broadest  essence, \nseeks  to  strengthen  the  knowledge  network  that  STEMGames  seeks  to  create.  My \nplugin  will  provide  an  interface  for  the  platform  admins  and  staff  to  link  topics  to  other \nexisting topics in such a way as to create a chain of content. One can imagine how this \ncould prove to be useful in a platform with educational content. For instance, a topic on \nCryptography could be linked to another topic on Number Theory as a prerequisite. This \nwould  encourage  the  user  to  read  up  on  Number  Theory  in  the  topic  linked  and  then \ncome  back  to  Cryptography.  In  essence,  this  will  allow the  education  process  to  be \nstreamlined and, moreover, it will enable STEMGames (and Discourse) to be used as a \nLearning Management System. The Topic Organizer plugin places an additional button \nin the topic admin menu which opens up a form with a search bar to search for topics to \nlink  to  the  current  topic  from  which  the  plugin  is  being  used.  After  the  desired  topics \nhave been searched and selected, a submit button on being clicked will add the topics \nto  a  postgres  DB.  Subsequently,  every  time  a  topic  page is  opened  which  has  other \ntopics  linked  to  it,  the  data  is  fetched  from  the  DB,  parsed  and  the  appropriate \nhyperlinks to the linked topics are displayed in a widget space created below the current \ntopic title. Thus, this will enable STEMGames users to navigate the platform with ease \nand in a manner curated by the subject matter experts to ensure a structured learning \nexperience. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: This  was  a  new  and  enriching  experience  for  me.  I  have  never \nworked in the field of web development before and there were a lot of new things I had \nto  learn  before  I  could  get  started  on  making  the  plugin  along  with  my  team.  For \ninstance, the languages. I have never worked with Ruby on Rails or JavaScript before. \nI  might  also  add  that  it  was  challenging  at  times, frustrating  even.  But  therein  lies  the \nbeauty that I have come to associate with the process of software development. It has \nit's ups and downs, but one has to learn to battle through it and push forward.. \nThis experience has been quite holistic. I have also learnt a great deal about what this \nprestigious institution stands for. Science Education. And I am glad to have had a hand \nin bettering the process and in doing so, a service to society. \n \n \n\n77 \n \nLearning Outcome : I learned a lot of new languages and tools such as, Ruby on Rails, \nJavascript, CSS, Docker, etc. More importantly, I learned to work as part of a software \ndevelopment team. \n \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course : I  feel  the  work  at  my  station  reflected  the \nveracity of the above statement to a great degree. \n \n------------"

The \ntopic  allotted  to  my  group  was  \"A.I.  chat-bot  for  Employee  Skill  Management\".  The \npurpose of this chat-bot was to help employees of the organization to manage their skill-\nset  in  organization's  database. With  the  help  of  this  chat-bot  an  employee  can  update \ntheir  skill-set  by  adding  a  new  skill  to  his/her  skill  set  or  can  update  his/her  level  of \nexpertise  in  a  skill  already  existing  in  his/her  skill-set.  It  also  provides an  additional \nfeature to the manager level employees to get a list of employees with a particular set of \nskills  in  order  to  make  decisions  on  starting  a  new  project  or  making  new  recruitment. \nTo develop the chat-bot we were initially given resources to learn some basic software \nrequired for the projects namely Python, Django, Dialogflow, Google Actions, Webhook, \nPostgreSQL etc. In the process of getting familiar with the above skills we made some \ndummy chat-bots.  After getting ourselves well equipped with the above skills we started \nworking   on   the   main   chat-bot   by   making   flowchart,   ER   diagram   of   database, \nimplementing  the  flowchart  in  Dialogflow,  making  the  database  in  Postgres,  using \nwebhook to provide dynamic response and the last step was user authentication. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  really  a  great  experience  working  in  such  an  esteemed \norganization.

The web \napplication we created was then deployed to the AWS (Amazon Web Services). \n \n \nPS-I experience: My experience during my PS was very good and I learnt many things. \nNot only the technical part like coding, but I also learned how to work and collaborate in \na team. PS at Kizora Software Pvt. Ltd. provided me a lot of exposure to work done in \nthe corporate sector. Thus, my experience was amazing. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome : 1.  Teamwork:  I  realized  the  importance  of  team  work  as  well  as \nhow do we need to consider others too while working in a team. Working in team also \nincreases  our  overall  knowledge  base  and  we  can  also  learn  new  things  from  our \nmembers. \n2. Crisis Management: Working hard is a good thing. But at the same time, we need to \nensure if we are working smartly or not, especially in times of crisis. \n3. Even though the work given to us in our PS station was not related to my branch, but \nstill it enhanced my interests for that subject. \n \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course : I  agree  to  the  statement  that  PS-1  is  an \nexposure oriented course. It exposes students to the professional world and introduces \nthem with the work done in the corporate sector.  \n \n------------"

My  project  was  related  to  office  networking  and  Integrated  Building \nManagement  System.  We  had  daily  one  to  two  hour  sessions  with  professionals  from \nthe  networking  department.    We  started  with  basics  of  networking  like  networking \n\n104 \n \ndevices, topologies, protocols, and the OSI model. They were covering the topics as per \nCCNA  course.  I  would  like  to  add  that  our  project  was  more  study  oriented  and  there \nwas  less  ‘hands-on’  work.  Once  we  were  accustomed  with  the  basics,  we  started \nworking  with  Cisco  Packet  Tracer,  a  freeware  used for  simulating  networks. We  learnt \nhow to configure a router, assign static or dynamic IPs, use RIP and make VLANs. We \nwere given tasks to make networks meeting the required specifications by our mentor. \nThen  we  switched  to  IBMS.  We  studied  various  components  of  IBMS  like  Parking \nsystem, CCTV surveillance, HVAC system, PA system etc. There wasn’t any work to do \nthere.  But  there  were  a  few  visits  to  the  respective  system  servers.  Next,  we  were \nintroduced  with  VOIP phones  and  how  they  are  configured on  a  network. We had few \nvisits to the data center. We also had one session each for VSAT and SCADA systems \nby  professionals  from  Scope  Minar,  ONGC  Data  Center.  Since  I  am  a  EEE  student,  I \nalso got a chance to visit the Gas generator system used by ONGC for in-house power \ngeneration. All in all, I learnt a lot of new things at ONGC. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Let’s discuss the good things first. Everyone was really helpful. The \nnetworking  team  was  eager  to  clear  our  doubts  and  I  learnt  a  lot  of  new  things  from \nthem.  Our  mentor  was  not  very  strict  about  the  project.  Despite  our  project  being \nnetworking  related,  he  allowed  us  to  visit  the  power  generation  system  and  also \nassigned  an  electrical  engineer  to  supervise  us.  And  we  did  that  along  with  our  main \nproject. The majority of our work was done on Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulator. Though \nwe had a lot of visits to the server rooms and got to see the networking devices in live \nenvironment.  Apart from that, another thing that wasn’t as good was that some new \ninterns arrived a week later than us but were assigned to the same batch as ours. As a \nresult few topics, that we had already done, had to be covered again. Apart from these \nminor  issues,  I  will  have  to  say  that  I  had  a really  good  time  at  ONGC  and  this  was  a \ngreat learning opportunity for me. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt the basics of Networking. I also got to know how a network \nis  designed  on  a  huge  scale  for  ONGC  like  organisations.  I  also learnt  how  they \nmanage all critical systems in such a large building. I learnt how, by combining all these \nsystems, some oil assets in Assam can be monitored by a person sitting in Delhi. \n \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course : I  very  much  agree  with  this statement.  After \ncovering the theoretical aspects of any field, be it networking or IBMS, I got to see how \nthose  systems  were  actually  implemented.  Visits  to  the  server  room  and  discussions \nwith professionals were an integral part of my PS1. So, I got to know how the industry \nactually implements the systems we study about in our books. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n105"

Our first approach was to \nuse data mining algorithms to find patterns in the data provided to us to come up with a \nmodel. But, we faced a lot of computational problems due to which we shifted to another \napproach involving neural networks. Our objective was to build a neural network which \nwill take in the flow rates of the tanks as an input and give the combination of valves as \nthe output. For this, we had to learn Python language, an extensive ML course, basics \nof  Pandas(a  library  in  Python)  and  TensorFlow(a  library  in  Python).  For  building  the \nneural  net,  we  had  to  first  decide  how  many  layers  we  are  going  to  use,  how  many \nneurons in each layer. We used 1 hidden layer with 1024 neurons. We also decided the \noptimizer and the loss function which plays an important role in deciding the accuracy of \nour  model.

Basically  we  needed  to find  different  valve \ncombination  such  that  it  gives  maximum  water  flow  output.  In  this  project  my  first  part \nwas  to  check  whether  there  is  any  relationship  between  the  two  important  variables  ( \nflowrate i.e. average speed of water and tank level) of the system. For that I used linear \nregression method. I found out correlation coefficients for the two variables using excel \nsheet  and  also  plotted  the  graph  using  matplotlib  library  in  python.  But  no  concrete \nresult  was  obtained  from  this  hence  we  decided  to  use  GAN  (Generative  Adversarial \nNetwork) which is used to generate new data from the raw data. So other work for me \nwas  to  write  a  code  for  the  neural  networks  using  GAN.  It  was  necessary  to  find  new \ndata  in  order  to  know  how  different  valve  combinations  work  whose  results  we  didn't \nhave in the raw data.

The  purpose of  the bot \nwas to help patients and visitors alike to navigate the myriad medical departments in the \nhospital. This usually takes, badgering the already busy hospital staff for directions and \nmultiple  trips  to  arrive  at  the  correct  department  and  ward.  The  bot  also  provides  the \nuser with the working of hours of all the medical departments, so that the user can plan \nhis/her  trips  accordingly  and  avoid  unnecessary  hassles.  We  used  dialogflow  to  build \nthe bot, and used firebase to deploy the cloud function. Also a website was created for \nupdating  the  department  location  data  of  the  hospital,  by  the  hospital  staff,  at  the \nrequest   of   our   incharge   Dr.Bruno   as   hospitals   changed   their   wards   frequently. \nSpecifically, our bot provides the user with the building number, floor, and room number, \nalong  with  the  department's working  hours.  Currently,  our  bot  works  in  two  platforms \ngoogle assistant and facebook messenger, Though google assistant has both voice and \ntext  input,  messenger  can  interact  with  only  text  input/output  with  the  user.  We  have \nsent for review of our apps to both facebook and google, and after analysis the may let \nus  make  the  app  public.  There  is  also  scope  of  expansion,  as  dialogflow  supports \nintegration with multiple messaging platforms. One possible future course of expansion \nis  the  application  can  be  expanded  to  different  use  cases  such  as  accomodating \nlaboratory timings and scheduling appointments etc. \n \n \n \n\n117 \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS  expereince  was  a  pleasant  one,  I  experienced  first  hand  on \nhow an office functions and had the chance to learn about creating chatbots which are \nmore prevalent in today's world, most companies use chatbots for customer service and \nit was interesting to learn how to make one. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : I learnt the python syntax, so that I could do basic programming in \nour project, which, we ultimately did not use. \nI learnt how to create a basic chatbot and the different components working in tandem \ninside one, a natural language processing engine which parses the message and sends \nmeaningful data to the cloud function, which sends the appropriate response back and \nthe database. \nI  also  learnt  that  the  best  way  to  work  in  an  organisation  is  to  show  practical  working \nresults. \n \n \nPS-I  is  an exposure  oriented  course : Sure,  some  of the things  I  was  exposed  to  in \nPS, cannot be acheived in a classroom. \n \n------------"

The  fields  available  were  ML,  AI, \nBlockchain, AR and VR. \nAfter some research, I chose to do the blockchain project. \nAt the end of 8 weeks, we had successfully learnt how to create a back end REST API \nusing  a  blockchain  to  store  data,  made  the  front  end  web  application  using  Angular \nusing  forms  and  services  and  routing,  and  MongoDB  for  database  requests.  We  also \nlearned  how  to  integrate  all  three,  and make  a fully functioning  web  application  on  the \nlocal  machine.  In  the  end,  we  tried  deploying  it  on  the  cloud,  however  due  to  time \nlimitations, we were unable to do that. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-1  experience  was  very  enriching.  I  worked  on  a  real  project \nwhere we had to focus on the functionality, and not just a proof of concept. This taught \nme  more  about  how  to  deal  with  real  world  problems,  which  sometimes  we  dont  even \nconsider when making a product. Other than that, i learned how to behave in an office \nenvironment, and learned that living a corporate life can also be fun. \n \n \nLearning Outcome : We learnt and understood the concepts of a blockchain, and how \nto  code  the  back  end  using  a  blockchain.  Further,  we  learnt  how  to  make  an  Angular \nweb  application,  and  integrate  all  of  this  to  form  a  fully  functioning  web  application. \nAlong the way, we also learned how to properly plan a project, how to break it down into \nsmaller pieces so one doesn't get overwhelmed, while still sticking to a schedule. \n \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course : Yes very much so. One of the most important \nthings i learned was how in the real world, results are more important than your efforts.  \nWe  learned  many  more  things  about  the  structure  of  the  organisation,  and  how  to \nconduct  oneself  in  meetings,  and  how  to  interact  with  ones  colleagues.

Apart from building custom NLP \napplications,  Alexa  Skills,  &  Google  actions,  VoiceQube  also  assists  enterprises  in \ncreating a voice interface to their existing web/mobile applications. \nOur  project involves  building  an  Alexa  skill  for  giving  clothing  suggestions.  User  data \nlike height, complexion, weight and occasion are taken into account to recommend the \nsuitable attire. Based on the inputs, one of the most fitting garments is picked from the \ndatabase. \nWhen the skill is invoked for the first time, the inputs ‘height’, ‘weight’, and ‘complexion’ \nare stored, and aren’t asked for again. But, if the user wants to change any of these \ninputs later, it can be done. Every time the skill is invoked, Alexa asks for the occasion \nand the time of the day, and gives suggestions accordingly. \nOne of the major challenges was creating an extensive database and coming up with a \nconsistent   system   to   give   a   suitable   suggestion.      We   managed   to   make   a \ncomprehensive  database  which  can  be  extended  and  modified  as  required.

Retail  Finance  in  India  is  a  fast  growing  industry  with  an  increase  of \napproximately  150%  in  operating  volume  year  over  year.  Most  people  choose  the \nindirect method of investing their capital in the market through intermediate instruments, \nsuch  as  mutual  funds,  etc.  due  to  the  lack  of  time  and experience  for  the  intraday \ntransaction.  An  intraday  trading  is  done  through  an  interface  called  Trading  Terminal. \nThis allows the trader to invest in the stock exchanges using their demat accounts. Most \ncommercial  terminals  provide  some  features,  such  as historical  chart  data,  technical \nand financial  indicators,  etc.,  to  get  a  general  idea  of  the financial  markets.  Merchants \ncan  use  tools  like  technical  analysis  that  use  historical  stock  prices  to  predict  future \nprices.

For  this  a  new  template  was  also  created  for \nProforma, including added fields for collecting data about funding requisitions, sanctions \nand  approvals.  Data  of  short  duration  courses  (ranging  between  1  week  to  upto  2 – 3 \nmonths)  offered  by  Foreign  Institutes  in  the  fields  of  Rural  Development,  Panchayati \nRaj,   Water    Research,    Agrarian    Studies,    Human    Resources    and    Information \nTechnology,  was  also  required  to  be  collected  for  the  FDS – Faculty  Development \nScheme.

The tank carries a crew of three \npersonnel. \nThe Tank is equipped with a 125 mm smooth bore gun stabilized in elevation and azimuth, \na coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun and a 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun installed on the \nCommander’s cupola \nThe  Tank  is  provided  with  a  high-accuracy  laying  and  sighting  material  and  with  an \nautomatic loading gear ensuring high effective rate of gun fire. \nThe anti-aircraft machine gun mount is provided with sighting and laying equipment. \nThus, making it possible to fight both aerial and ground targets. \n\n17 \n \nThe  Tank  is  equipped  with  devices  designed  to  protect  the  crew  and  inner  equipment \nfrom a  shock  wave  in  case of a nuclear  explosion,  as  well  as  to  protect  the  crew from \nradiological  agents.  As  to  penetrating  radiation,  the  crew  and  inner  equipment  are \nprotected by means of sealing of the vet. \nThere is a provision made for under water stream-crossing equipment, smoke-generating \nequipment for placing smoke screen, and fire-fighting system is designed to extinguish \nthe fire inside the tank. \n \nPS-I  experience: The  key  problem  we  tackled  during  our  tenure  at  505  Army  Base \nWorkshop was finding solutions as well as suggesting efficient modifications in the testing \nsystem of the Electrical Starter Circuit of a T -72 tank. To achieve this, we referred to the \nprécis issued to us by the TT Cell library, took part in on-field demonstrations of an actual \ntank  and  its  various  electrical/electronic  components  as  well  as  carried  out  numerous \nhands  on  tasks in  the  TEG  (Tank  Electronic  Group)  section  at  the  Workshop.  The \nElectrical Starter Circuit: is a starter cum charging device for the T -72 tank which puts \ntogether  various  components  and  controls  how  the  batteries  are  combined  together  to \ngive the appropriate voltage required. \nWe divided our project into multiple phases which begins with the studying of independent \ncomponents of the circuit. Later, our goal switched to focusing on the circuit model: as a \nwhole. Since the major tasks carried out at dine Workshop are testing and repairing, we \nsignificantly focused on first delving into, how the testing process is done and the issues \nfaced during it. This ultimately helped us come up with a set of ideas to modify the existing \nprocess by suggesting healthier alternatives. \n \nLearning outcome : Looking at the motive with which we began this project, we came a \nlong  way  beginning  with  an  optimistic  approach  of  suggesting  electronic  alternatives. \nInitially, it seemed a bit odd to find an abundance of electrical components like resistors \nand motors in every component that was researched upon. But with time, when the entire \ncircuit  was  studied  in  prospect,  it  was  realised  how  safety  and  security  is  of  utmost \nimportance in front of any other factor like cost, power consumed etc. Hence, the perfect \ncombination of  relay  devices  along  with  amplifying  components  like  BJTs  is  present  to \nensure  systematic  organisation  as  well  as  increased  durability.  However,  it  cannot  be \ncompletely  ignored  that  remaining  stuck on analog  circuits  does  act  as  a  shortcoming. \nWith changing necessities, the need of the hour is accepting digital technology for faster \nprocessing and better results. Analysis did pop up the question of reliability, but on this \nfront,  we  have  to  accept  that  multiple  simulations  and  testing  under  varied  conditions \nwould be necessary before accepting this change. Yet, going through this grind has a big \nadvantage in the longer time. \nAnother  factor  to  be  taken  into  account  is  the  tedious  nature  of  the  testing  process. \nDespite the knowledge on which relay is causing an issue in the circuit, every individual \npart has to undergo the entire LED light detector process before the defects in the circuit \nare found. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course : The  shift  from  book knowledge to  practical \nactivities  is  enlightening.  Transcending  from  theoretical  concepts  to  actually  handling \n\n18 \n \nmachineries, both through hands on tasks and through lectures by instructors, proves to \nbe a major learning curve.  \n \n \n----------"

            "writeUp": "Student Write-up  \n \nShort Summary of work done :  \nMy  PS  1(BITS  F221)  journey  began  well.  Each  one  of us  have  been  allotted the  plant \nwhere  we're  supposed  to  report  to.  There  was  an  orientation  session  given  by \nRaghuraman Sir. Mr. Natarajan (the plant head) has talked to us regarding himself and \nCUMI. We were then introduced to our mentors and toured the plant, going through the \n5 modules (rubber, vitrified(small dial), vitrified(big dial), resin and SFC(super finishing) \nof the manufacturing process at TVT. The project I received is to understand the concept \nof  temperature  uniformity  in  a  batch  microwave  oven  machine  and  why  we  require  it. \nThen, find factors to improve upon the same, which can be done using change in design, \nvariation of product parameters with the machine, change in input parameters like specific \nheat etc. We  began  researching  in  the field  of  our  projects  by  understanding  the  main \nobjectives,  and  basic  principle  behind  the  working.  We  interacted  with  the  mentor-in-\ncharge and the workers at the allotted project stations to observe the process and draw \nthe  necessary  values  that  can  get  us  started  on  our  research.  Raghuraman  Sir  had \noccasional visits to the plant and we had a group discussions based on our projects as \npart  of  the  evaluation,  and  oral  open  book  quizzes  based  on  CUMI  and  our  projects. \nMoreover, we continued to work on our projects by collecting as much data required. After \nour Midsemester Review, we started to find out ways to implement our ideas for improving \nthe problem. The problem behind disuniformity was what we discovered, called Moding. \nModing occurs when the microwave electric field inside of the tube can no longer maintain \nthe  oscillation  in  pi-mode  because  of  the  disturbance  by  the  reflected  waves  from  the \nload, resulting in an unusual oscillation. After days of researching, talking to the workers \nof the plant, assistance from our mentors and working on the shaft floor, we came up with \na  solution  called  the  Phase  shifting  method.  The  electrical  field  pattern  located  in  the \n\n41 \n \nwaveguide  (called  mode)  usually  varies  for  different  structures  of  the  cavity  and  the \ncharacters  of  processing  materials.  The  sliding  short  (connected  to  the  end  of  the \nwaveguide) can be exploited to change the spatial distribution of the microwave field in \nthe waveguide system. As the terminal of the cavity is shorted, only standing waves exist \nin the waveguide. The position of the sliding short is an electric field node, λ/4 away from \nan antinode. The node and antinode reappear every other λ/2. Therefore, the distribution \nof the electric field in the cavity and the amplitude of the electric field applied to the sample \ncan be changed by moving the position of the sliding short. In this way, it is then possible \nto generate different intensities of electric field in the position of the sample, avoiding hot \nor cold  spots  resulting  from  non  uniform  static  electric  field  distribution.  Finally  after \npresenting  our  research  and  work  done  through  PS  to  Raghuraman  Sir  and  the  plant \nhead,  we  got  satisfactory  responses  and  were  handed  certificates  regarding  the  same \nand the journey came to an end. \n \n \nPS-I experience: I was satisfied with the PS I was allotted. I looked forward to understand \nthe real life operations of the organization. Orientation was well organized and helped me \nunderstand the structure of the organization. I was able to understand the nature of work \nand  projects.The  learning  environment  between  organization  and  students  was  very \nencouraging. I was able to adjust well to the team assigned. The experience gave me a \nchance to enhance my presentation skills and communication skills. I received adequate \nsupport from my mentors, instructor and batch mates. At last, my project was a relevant \ncontribution to the organization. \n \nLearning outcome : 1. Learnt the rubber module of manufacturing (flute grinding cycle), \nright  from  pre  forming  which  includes  mixing,  moulding,  and  avoiding  lumps  to  hot \npressing  to  ensure  compactness  at  the  desired  temperature(165  degrees  celsius)  to \nensure uniformity in density and volume. From then, to woven curing and finally sent to \nthe resinoid model. \n2. Understanding the outline of microwave processing (one project) by studying the basic \nprocess that's involved at home and making comparisons to the microwave oven used in \nthe module 2 of TVT. Next, how that leads to hot pressing (another project of other group) \nand most importantly, the role of temperature uniformity in both the projects. \n3. Understood in detail about the working of the machine, the details of the components, \nand  the  importance  of  the  machine  in  the  process. Furthermore,  I've  understood  the \nrequirement of temperature uniformity (the problem to solve) in my project. \n4. Learnt about the design and working of the machine, collected various data points of \nthe sample throughout the week and learnt to make observations, and learnt details that \ncan  help  us  improve  the  problem  stated  in  our  project- inconsistent  temperature \nuniformity. \n5. Our idea has been developed from understanding that Maxwell's equations govern the \npropagation of electromagnetic field in the Batch Microwave, and moving the sliding short \n(connected at the end of the waveguide) by a displacement simultaneously is the same \nas changing the permittivity and permeability values by a constant, when we thought to \napply  the  theory  of  transformation  optics.  Finally,  the  movement  will  influence  the \ndistribution  of  the  electric  field  in  the  cavity  and  the  presumed  results  will  find  an \n\n42 \n \nimprovement in the data temperature values at the arbore and periphery and find more \nuniformity.  \n6. Introduced to new concepts and instruments. \n6.  Lastly,  Importance  of  responsibility,  adherence  to  time,  attitude,  patience,  and \nunderstanding your work at the station (applying practical knowledge). \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course : Yes, it's definitely an exposure oriented course.  \nIts  been  a  great  learning  experience.  Applying  concepts  you  learn  in  college  at  the \norganization  was  amazing.  Its  truly  enhanced  my  practical  skills  and  improved  my \nprofessional conduct. \n \n \n----------"

The main aim of the project \nwas to decrease the cycle (operation) time of a CNC machine process, thus increasing \nproductivity. It included the analysis of the various load operation regions of the machine, \ndevelopment  of  an  algorithm  for  updating  feed  rate  dynamically,  and  designing  of a  \nLadder Logic of the algorithm for a Programmable Logic Controller(PLC). Also carried out \nwas the tuning of PD control parameters and actual testing of the Ladder Logic on a CNC \nmachine, by integrating it into the PLC of the machining center. An object made of Mild \nSteel  was  processed  multiple  times,  and  trends  of  the  tuning  parameters  were  noted. \nClear  graphs,  showing  the  difference  in  times  and  performance  with  and  without  the \nadaptive control feature were plotted in the results. These highlighted a decrease in time \nof close to 18%  due to the feature. Also seen was a significant increase in tool operating \nlife, and decrease in power consumption by the machine. \n \nPS-I experience: It was, first and foremost, a highly enriching experience. I had a clear \nand well defined project, which also had a lot of scope for learning and experimenting. \n\n47 \n \nThroughout the project, I was always facing new challenges, but never those that were \nbeyond my ability.

This involved study, \nobservation  and  analysis  of  root  problems  and  test  run  on proposed  models.  The \ncompany utilizes the largest chain conveyor system in India for Heavy Duty Trucks (HDT) \ncovering  a  length  of  292  meters,  which  has  a  total  of  62  assembly  stations,  with  each \nstation  having  specific  and  custom-built  equipment.  I  studied 17  major  equipment  and \nhelped   them   in   framing   a   methodology   to   track   their   functioning   through   MES \n(Manufacturing  Execution  Systems).  I  worked  on  the  prevention  of  radio  frequency \ninterference in the Electric monorail system by using dynamic beam forming and spatial \nmultiplexing. I was involved in building an equipment breakdown contingency model for \nwindshield manipulator (pneumatic equipment), which is used for mounting windshield on \n\n49 \n \nHDT Cabin, through 3-D modelling and simulation (performed using Ansys Spaceclaim \nand  AutoCAD  Fusion  360).  I  presented  a  formal  report  of  the  contingency  model, \nmentioning the cost, investment, bill of materials, fabrication techniques to the head team \nat  the  maintenance  department.  I  also  did  a  collab  project  with  some  other in-plant \ntrainees on designing a new improved prototype of a fixture, which is used to mount HDT \nCabin  on  pre-paint  Dip-Skid  trolley.  We  actually  manufactured  the  prototype  in  the \ncompany's  metal  fabrication  area  and  conducted five  test  runs,  out  of  which four  were \nsuccessful.  One  of  the  successful  tests  was  attended  by  the  Head  Of  Maintenance \nDepartment. \n \nPS-I  experience: This  industrial  experience  was  my  first-time  step  into  a  professional \nfield. Through their orientation program, I got the opportunity to visit every department of \nthe  organisation  and  get  a  know-how  of  the  manufacturing  processes,  materials, \nequipment, quality checks, safety standards and work environment. This programme did \nreally  enhance  my  skills  particularly  in  communication,  presentation  of  information, \nthinking  skills,    how  to  design  with  real-time  constraints  and  much  more.  The  testing \nprocess; the quality feedback loop system and total productive maintenance were really \nfascinating to observe. The work culture is pretty stern here and they expect you to follow \nthe same. There are restrictions on visiting certain places and you have to have official \npermission for that. Apart from this, the managers, supervisors and team were supportive, \napproachable and frank in sharing knowledge with me to which I am thankful. They did \nevery possible task I needed to implement for my model testing purposes. The food here \nisn't bad either, it is routine food and healthy. This internship has given me new insights \nand motivation to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. \n \n \nLearning outcome : During my training period, I learned a lot from observing, reading \ndocuments and manuals and by sharing my knowledge with my friends. \nThe   list   includes   manufacturing   processes,   truck   assembly   and   subassembly \ncomponents,  equipment  like  KUKA  industrial  robots,  manipulators,  hoists,  6S  safety \nchecklist,  manufacturing  materials  and  components,  pneumatic  and  hydraulic  circuits, \nPLC  logic  circuits,  professional  environment,  work  ethics  and  plenty  more.

Our main objective was to figure out the \ndifference in the cost and equipments required if instead of taking 40.5% Caustic from the \nChemical  Division  and  diluting  it  ourselves  to  18%,  we  take  32%  Caustic  directly  from \nthem. We had to analyse the feasibility and cost of the alternative system suggested by \nus.   After   studying   various   processes   and   looking   at   both   the   advantages   and \ndisadvantages of the alternative system, we came to the conclusion that we should shift \nto taking 32% directly from the Chemical Division as it will be profitable to us in the long \nrun, it is simpler and more efficient.  The Chemical division ends up saving a huge amount \n\n59 \n \nof money. Since both these plants are integrated, when looked at together we would save \na huge amount of energy and resources by shifting to the alternative system. \n \nPS-I experience: This was a very different and learning experience.

In the RO process the RO membare is supposed \nto demineralise water, basically refine it enough to remove particles upto the sizes of 500 \nnanometers.

But    corrosion  poses  a  great  threat  to  them  resulting  in  leaks,  bursts,  fatal \naccidents etc. causing loss of wealth and lives.  \nPSP Surveys are carried out to monitor the corrosion health of the pipelines and location \nof  'hot  spots'.  Assuming  that  the  buried  pipeline  is  protected  using  Impressed  Current \nCathodic Protection (ICCP), then any defects in the coating will result in electric current \nflowing  from  the  surrounding  soil  and  into  the  pipe.  These  currents  cause  voltage \ngradients to be set up in the soil, which can be measured using a voltmeter. By looking \nat  the  direction  of  these  gradients,  the  location  of  coating  faults  may  be  identified.    By \nmeasuring  the  localised  soil  potentials  with  respect  to  remote  earth,  a  measure  of  the \neffectiveness of the cathodic protection may be calculated.

The first project required us to search for innovative ideas for \nsolar panels installation and try to apply it on the railway rolling stock. We conducted site-\nvisits of the railway workshop for feasibility \ncalculations and looked for previous studies and reports for reference and \ncitations. \nWe first studied the basic working of solar panels based on p-n junction model and then \nlooked at some researches to provide latest method and innovation in the solar energy \nfield. We suggested the Railways to research more on the field of STPV (Solar Thermal \nPhoto Voltaic) cells, which is a research innovation of MIT scientists.  \n2.) The other project involved the survey of waste generation on railway \npremises and to determine a feasible “waste to energy” model via the \nemployment of a stable supply chain mechanism. \nHere, we conducted a door-to-door survey in the Kishan Ganj railway colony, Delhi and \nasked the residents about the issues they are facing on waste disposal. We also made \nposters to aware them of the proper disposal methods. Then we estimated the amount of \nwaste  (dry  and  wet)  that  could  have  been  produced  in  the  colony  if  there  was  proper \nsegregation and further this could have been used in the bio-gas plants. \n \nPS-I  experience: The  PS-1  station  was  a  government office,  thus  I  experienced  the \ndynamics of a government office. I came to know about the work load of the officials and \nhow they complete their targets.  \nThe  projects  which  I  did  were  based  on  conservation  of  environment  and  use  of  non-\nconventional energy, thus to learn about these topics was an added advantage. \n \nLearning outcome : 1.) As the projects were provided in groups, I developed leadership \nskills as at various stages I led the group to make sure the project was completed in time. \n2.) I learnt about corporate job structure and need to follow strict schedules. \n3.) I learnt about solar energy and bio-gas production techniques. \n4.) I came to know about the method of making a report. \n5.) I learnt about the procedure to conduct surveys. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure oriented  course : YES,  I  agree  with  the  above  statement.

We also gained domain knowledge in website hosting and \nback-end algorithm development and management. Our mentor stressed about security \nwhile  building  the  website.  Appropriate  security  measures  have  been  taken  for  the \n\n107 \n \ndevelopment of the website to protect it from hackers once the website is launched. The \ncompany assisted us in developing skills in this arena as well as the overall project. \nAn  important  skill  learnt  by  us during  this  program  was  working  professionally  with  the \nemployees of the organization to do critical value-addition to the products of the company \nand in process develop and enhance our soft-skills. This program and our project gave \nus valuable insights into the corporate culture of multi-national companies like KEC and \nin turn teaching us a lot about professionalism and work-ethics. This program helped us \nto understand about working on a small module of a big project and then working on the \nchallenging but the most interesting part of integrating these small modules into building \nthe entire project. \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course : I completely agree with this. Working at an MNC \ninstills a corporate culture in students and allows us to witness the industry even before \nworking there.  The  exposure  gained  during  PS-1  has  been  important  to  the  overall \ndevelopment. \n \n \n----------"

After that \nI learned about different types of milling machine and about grinding machine and their \nimportance in mechanical workshop in steel plant. The second part involve observation \nof different steel plant processes happening across the plant starting with pickling which \nis treating of hot rolled coil (that comes from steel plant in Angur, Orissa) with HCl to turn \ncoil into rust free coil. The rolling where the thickness of the coil is reduced from 4 mm to \n0.50 mm. Then  ECL (Electrolytic Cleaning Line) where coil is treated with Unikleen 84 B \nat high temperature. After that annealing this is heat treatment process to get back desired \nmechanical properties. After that skin pass process where hardness and tensile strength \nof  coil  is  increased  and  is  given  surface  finish  (Matt  or  Bright  depending  on  the  need) \nAfter that it is treated with rust preventive oil. And finally finishing which is about CTL and \nCRS  process.  The  third  part  involves  manufacturing  and  observation  of  coil  wrapping \nmachine in mechanical workshop where my task was to calculate the speed of coil and \nring  holding  the  wrapping  bandage  so  that they  can  work  simultaneously,  and  packing \ncan be done \n \nPS-I  experience: My  experience  at  TATA  STEEL  BSL  was  fantastic  I  learned  about \ndifferent processes in plant and about the importance of workshop in steel plant.

We  pre-\nprocessed these by removing the confidence values and converting these into an array \nof coordinates and one more array of the corresponding labels. Python was used along \nwith  it's  deep-learning  assisting  modules.  At  a  time,  a  label  was  associated  with  45 \nframes of a single video. These were split into training, validation and testing sets in the \nratio  of  60:20:20  respectively  and  then  passed  through  a  recurrent  neural  network \n(RNN) . A training accuracy of 99.7%, maximum validation accuracy of 99.3% and a test \naccuracy of  99.6% were obtained. In real-time, we were generating JSON files from a \nweb-cam  and  trying  to  detect  humans  in  each  frame  using  YOLOv2  using  a  different \nweb-cam  simultaneously.  Real  time  predictions  for  1  and  2  persons  were  quite \naccurate. \n \nPS-I  experience: PS-I was  quite  an  enthralling  experience.  I  got  to  learn  a  lot  of  new \nthings  from  various  software  to  working  in  a  team.  I  got  a  chance  to  be  a  part  of  an \ninstitute where cutting-edge research is performed to invent the state of the art models, \ndevices and technologies. It was amazing to handle stuff which wasn't readily available \nfor   commercial   use.   The   exposure   and   overall-development   one   gets   here   is \nunmatched. \n \nLearning  outcome: I  learned  the  practical  implementation  of  various  deep-learning \nalgorithms like CNNs and RNNs. I also learned transfer learning and making predictions \nif  you  are  provided  with  a  pre-trained  neural  network.  I  also  worked  with  various \n\n56 \n \nmodules of python like Keras, OpenCV, TensorFlow, seaborn,  numpy, matplotlib, etc. I \nalso understood the importance of real-time analysis. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: PS-I is  more  than  just  an  exposure  oriented \ncourse.  One  gets  to  learn  and  implement  various  things  and  you  learn  a  lot  of \ntechnological things. The exposure you get of the ongoing research in your nation and \nhow  you  can  contribute  to  it  or  industrial  exposure  is  amazing.  Also, the  wonderful \nstories of experience the scientists here have to share make your day! \n \n-------------"

The first phase of the project work was \nlearning   about   deep   learning.   We   were   asked   to   watch   the   deeplearning. AI \nspecialisation  in  deep  learning  available  on  YouTube  and  Coursera.  This  course  gave \nus  an  introduction  to  what  deep  learning  is  how  it  is  implemented  and  what  tools  are \navailable etc. The next phase of the project was a literature review. Our mentor asked \nus to read about the various strategies and tools based on deep learning that have been \nused  in  the  academia  to  analyse  360-degree  videos.  Although, there  has  been \nextensive research on the applications of computer vision in regular videos there is not \nas  much  work  done  on  360-degree vision. One paper we came across was ‘Saliency \nDetection in 360-degree videos. \n[http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ziheng_Zhang_Saliency_D\netection_in_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf].    Researches    had    used    a    unique    spherical \nconvolution to implement the popular U-Net for saliency detection in 360-degree videos. \nWe decided to base our work on this paper and there was also a link available to their \ncode  for  spherical  convolution. Then,  we  wanted  to  simply  use  this  code  for  the \nspherical  convolution  as  an  I/O  black  box  and  fit  it  into  a  object  detection  architecture \nlike VGG16 instead of the U-Net. However, we faced a lot of problems at this stage as \nwe  were  unable  to  simply  port  the  modules  from  this  work  to  ours.  We  also  faced \nproblems because the dataset was on baidu and thus in chinese. We also worked on a \nliterature review of fall detection techniques. \n \nPS-I experience: I had specifically chosen this PS-I station (CEERI, Pilani) because a \nsenior had told that they offer good projects based on deep learning. So, I had come to \nthe PS-I station hoping to get a project on Deep Learning and learn to implement it . My \nexperience  was  quite  close  to  my  expectations.  I  was  able  to  get  a  project  in  Cyber \nPhysical  Systems  department  which  was  offering  deep  learning  projects.  Our mentor \nwas  extremely  helpful.  He  told  us  what  resources  we  should  start  learning  from  and \n\n57 \n \nthen  slowly  introduced  us  to  our  projects.  It  was  good  experience  and  exposure  for  a \nbeginner in deep learning like me. \n \nLearning outcome: The main learning outcome of my project during the PS-I is that I \nnow  have  an  understanding  of  deep  learning  and  its  functions  and  implementations. \nApart  from  this  knowledge  I  have  also  learnt a  lot  of  about  my  specific  project  a  lot.  I \nknow  about  several  architectures  used  in  the  academia  for  computer  vision  and  have \nalso learnt about processing 360-degree videos using deep learning. \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course: Yes, I agree that PS-I is an exposure oriented \ncourse  because  of  the  nature of  the  projects  we  get  and how  we  are  required  to  work \nalongside    professionals.  The  experience  is  very  different  from  the  college  setting  and \nprovides a good opportunity to learn. \n \n-------------"

We  first  created  a formal \nmechanism  for  obtaining  surface  potential  created  by  the  bio-molecular  which  is \nequivalent  to  the  gate  potential  in  the  simulation.  The  analysis  was  done  in  practical \nsettling time regime. We then created an intricate mechanism to optimize the device by \nanalysing  the  variation  in  sensitivity  characteristics  of  a Silicon  nanowire  of  various \nshapes,  at  various  lengths,  diameters,  doping  concentration,  oxide  thickness,  applied \ndrain  voltage,  reference  voltage,  salt  concentration  and  pH.

We  got  an  exposure  to the  well \nequipped labs and got a chance to work there. \n \nLearning   outcome: Learned   that   research   is   completely   based   on   incremental \ncontribution.  This  field  requires  extensive  analysis  of  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  under \nvarious  parameters.  Through  the  use of  nanowires,  one  can  circumvent  the  problems \ncaused by extensive scaling of MOSFETs. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: PS-I provides  great  exposure  in  terms  of \nknowledge  gained and  the  practical  usage  of  the  knowledge  provided  to us  during  our \ncourse work  during  the  semesters  on  campus.

We first familiarised ourselves with deep learning by doing courses from \ndeeplearning.ai. We  then  conducted a  thorough  literature  survey  before  identifying  our \napproach to the project. The project aims to take real-time footage of the driver, detect \nface  and  eyes,  find  if  there  is  a  blink  and  based  on  the  temporal  pattern  of  blinking, \npredict  if  the  driver  is  alert,  semi-sleepy  or  drowsy.

The first phase of the project work was \nlearning   about   deep   learning.   We   were   asked   to   watch   the   deeplearning. AI \nspecialisation  in  deep  learning  available  on  YouTube  and  Coursera.  This  course  gave \nus  an  introduction  to  what  deep  learning  is  how  it  is  implemented  and  what  tools  are \navailable etc. The next phase of the project was a literature review. Our mentor asked \nus to read about the various strategies and tools based on deep learning that have been \nused  in  the  academia  to  analyse  360-degree  videos.  Although, there  has  been \nextensive research on the applications of computer vision in regular videos there is not \nas  much  work  done  on  360-degree vision. One paper we came across was ‘Saliency \nDetection in 360-degree videos. \n[http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ziheng_Zhang_Saliency_D\netection_in_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf].    Researches    had    used    a    unique    spherical \nconvolution to implement the popular U-Net for saliency detection in 360-degree videos. \nWe decided to base our work on this paper and there was also a link available to their \ncode  for  spherical  convolution. Then,  we  wanted  to  simply  use  this  code  for  the \nspherical  convolution  as  an  I/O  black  box  and  fit  it  into  a  object  detection  architecture \nlike VGG16 instead of the U-Net.

I personally \nfeel that a lot of good work is done at research institutes hence at any research institute \nwe  must  first  understand  its  each  and  every  domain and  then  only  decide  what we \nactually want to do because I felt that I made a little hurry in deciding about the project \nwithout  giving much  thought  to  it  and also  of  the  fear  that  good  projects  may  not \nbecome unavailable but then I realized that many more interesting projects were there \nwhich  others  students  did.  But, overall  it  was  a  nice  experience  working  under  the \nguidance of some renowned scientist and actually developing something of our own. \n \nLearning  outcome: We  learnt  signal  processing  in  matlab  and  python  programming \nlanguage. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: I  feel  it  is  a  great  initiative  to  give  us  an \nexposure  about  the  outside  world.

It  also \nhelped  me  to  develop  some  professional  skills  and  how  to  deal  with  different  kinds  of \npeople. \n\n38 \n \n \n-------------"

One  of  the  popular \nantenna  is  microstrip patch  antenna  because  it  can  be  directly  printed  on  a  circuit \nboard.The  disadvantages  are  it  has  narrow  bandwidth  and  less  efficiency,gain.

To  improve  the  gain  further  a  parabolic  reflector  is  used \nbecause of which the gain has been profoundly increased and even the directivity.

One  of \nthe sustainability problems which the humankind is facing is the unavailability of a stable \nforms  of  renewable  energy.  There  exist  sources  of  renewable  energy  in  the  world \naround us as of today such as wind power,  hydro electrical energy, solar power et. al. \nBut   these   forms   of   are   inherently   plagued   by   various   disadvantages   such – \nunavailability of wind and solar power as a continuous and stable form of energy in all \nparts  of  the  earth  or  expense  and  the  environmental  stress  caused  as  a  result  of \ninstalling hydroelectric power plant. \nMy project was aimed towards a form of energy which is feasible and the raw material \nfor  which  is  easily  available  in  any  nook  and  corner  of  the  country.  I  came  across  bio \nethanol as a form of energy which was widely gaining popularity due to it being a clean \nand cheap form of energy. Moreover, it could be prepared from agricultural waste by the \naction  of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  commonly  known  as  yeast.  I  took  on  the  much \nvaluable work of producing bio ethanol from fruit waste. The project was of much value \nto the institute too as some end product was going to get prepared from scrap and junk. \nThe process employed was alcoholic fermentation on the fruit waste. After fermentation \nof the waste, the yeast produced ethanol. \n \nPS-I  experience: My  experience  in  brief  was  excellent.  There  was  no  restriction  from \nmy  mentor  regarding  the  complexities  involved  in  attendance  part.  My  mentor's  sole \npurpose was to utilize the potential for work related to my project. \n\n81 \n \nAlso, there was not a single instance of working in a place which was unfamiliar to me \nbefore PS-I, as there were other trainees working on the same project who were more \nthan happy to provide valuable cues for my own project work. \n \nLearning  outcome: I  learnt  a  lot  about  the  potential  uses  of  sustainable  fuel  such  as \nbio-ethanol.  Also,  I  learnt  about  the  process  of  preparing  bio-ethanol  from  waste \nproducts and the various substrates and organisms involved in the process. \nApart from the academic aspects of the work, ability to work in a team and co-ordinate \nmy  efforts  with  others  towards  the  same  goal  was  also  delivered  in  the  learning \npackage. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: The  statement  is  particularly  appropriate for  a \nproject  based  on  biological  systems  and  biotechnology.  On  theory,  one  doesn't  know \nwhat   various   practical   problems   one   could   face   because   the   problems   are   not \ngeneralized  and  don't  involve  any  algorithmic  solution  to  the  problem  due  to  localized \nnature of such problems. One has to use his wit under the guidance of industry experts \nto  reach  towards  a  heuristic  solution.  PS-I with  the  exposure  it  provides,  acts  towards \ngalvanizing theory based knowledge and the practical problem solving realm. \n \n-------------"

Since, I was unaware of the \nconcepts, I spent the first two weeks to be acquainted with the literature. Usually, deep \nlearning practitioners use pre-trained models to perform their tasks. In my case, though, \nI  had  to  build  the  convolutional  neural  network  from  scratch  and  train  it  by  generating \nthe  dataset  on  my  own.  After  training  the  model  and  obtaining  a  decent  enough \naccuracy,  I  went  on  to  apply  the  sliding  window  technique  to  count  trees  in  the  first \nimage  provided,  which  contained  four  channels.  I  further  analyzed  my  result  with  the \nhelp  of  another  image  provided  to  me,  but  this  time,  the  image  contained  three \nchannels.  Henceforth,  I  was  compelled,  and  had  enough  time,  to  train  a  fresh  model \nusing  images  cropped  from  this  image  and  then  repeat  the  same  procedure  so  as  to \nobtain the tree count. I further explored fusion techniques and mathematical morphology \nso as to further improve my model. \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  nice to  work  in  a  highly  professional  environment.  The \nscientists  at  IIRS  are very  supportive  and  are  always  ready  to  help.  One  thing  which  I \nfelt quite striking was the attitudinal differences among various scientists, in terms of the \nexpectations  from  the  students  whom  they  guided.  Not  delving  deeper  into  these \npsychological  differences,  this  institute  provides  an  opportunity,  even  to  a  summer \ntrainee, to explore new avenues through proper guidance. \n \nLearning outcome: First of all, I learnt basic etiquettes which need to be followed while \nworking in an organisation. This is something which no book and no course can teach; it \nhas to be gained through exposure and experience. Next, through this project, I got an \nopportunity  to  explore  the  field  of  computer  vision and  find  out  how  it  actually  works, \nalbeit  in  a  minor  sense.  Applying  the  knowledge  gained  throughout  my  stay  here, \nirrespective of whether I obtained correct results or not, added value to my learning. \n \n\n114 \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: I  personally  believe  it  is  an  exposure  oriented \ncourse, but how much a student can gain from it, this solely depends on his/her attitude. \nFrom  my  experience  here,  I  can  say  that,  it  is  never  easy  to  learn  a  new  thing  while \nmeeting the expectations of the organisation you're working in. It is at that time that the \ncharacter of a person is judged; whether the person tries to run away or faces it bravely \nwhile  simultaneously  showing  composure  and  calmness. This  is  the  exposure  which  a \nstudent gets through PS-I, well before he/she is hired to work as a professional and is \npaid for it, for nobody can predict in advance whether he/she will be recruited in a MNC \nto  perform  only  that  kind  of  work  which  he/she  has  mastered  upon  through  his/her \nefforts  during  college  life,  or  not. Another  thing  worth  mentioning  here  is  that  any \nstudent  who  opts  for  any  institute  through  PS-I goes  there  to  learn and  gain  industrial \nexperience. \n \n-------------"

It \nallows  the  user  to  perform  various  tasks  by  signing  in  to  the  software  with  the  help  of \ncredentials  provided  by  the  administrator.  After  authentication,  the  user  can  access \nfunctionalities  like  Point  cloud  processing,  Image  processing,  getting  the  views  of  the \nheritage site and Database querying, which are organized in a simple tool. For this, the \nuser  should  be  equipped  with  an  elementary  knowledge  of  computing  and  point  cloud \nhandling.  \nPoint  cloud  processing  and  Image  processing  provides  several  features  like  Edge \nDetection,  Corner  Detection,  RGB  to  HIS,  HIS to  RGB,  Texture  Analysis  and  Change \nDetection  and  Crack Detection. The  software  can  also  convert  the  3D  point  cloud  to  a \n2D image whose point and image attributes can be stored in the PostgreSQL database \nand visualized by the user through the interface. Moreover, 3D point cloud data can be \nstored  in  compressed  patches  in  a  database  with  the  help  of  database  querying.

This \nsemiconductor has a band gap of 4.8eV due to which it can absorb and emit photons of \nhibgh  energy  lying  in  the  UV  region,  and  thus  is  a  very  good  material  to  use  in  solar \nblind UV detectors. Further this semiconductor not only has a wide band gap but also it \nhas  a  direct  band  gap  which  is  characteristic  property  of  most  of  the  metal  oxide \nsemiconductors. These two property of this beta-Ga2O3 makes it an excellent material \nfor  power  electronics  industry  and  is  predicted  to  outclass  the  performance  of  existing \ntechnology  of  SiC  and  GaN.  So  this  report  is  based  on  how  to  grow  single  crystals  of \nGa2O3 since it is very important material from research point of view, and scientists are \ntrying  their  best  to  bring  this  material  into  practical  use.  This  project  covers  all  the \nfundamentals of crystal growth. \nIt not only covers the mechanism of crystal growth but also the thermodynamics behind \nit. Sound knowledge of both crystal growth mechanism and phase diagrams is required \n\n133 \n \nto understand various crystal  growth technique in depth. So this  project covers all the \nfundamentals  of  crystal  growth  and  also  basics  of  crystal  growth  techniques  involiving \ncrystal growth from its melt. We not only prepared the samples of beta Ga\n2\nO\n3\n, but also \ncharacterized  it  using  X-Ray  diffraction,  Raman  Spectroscopy,  UV-Visible  absorption \nspectroscopy,   and   Photoluminescence   spectroscopy.   X-ray   diffraction   showed   no \ndifference in the diffraction pattern upon doping the sample with Cr, which mans that the \nstructure  of  the  crystals  remain  same.  Raman  spectroscopy  revealed  that,  the  Cr  ions \nare going into the interstitial site, of tetrahedral voids of Oxygen sub-lattice. \nFurther, we calculated the band gap of Ga\n2\nO\n3\n single crystal samples, using UV-Visible \nabsorption  spectroscopy,  and  we  found  that  band  gap  decreases  with  the  increase  in \nthe  dopant  concentration.  We  also  unveiled  the  presence  of  additional energy  level  in \nthe forbidden gap. \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  very  pleasant  and  fruitful,  as  it  helped  to  develop  a  scientific \ntemperament.   I   got   opportunity   to   interact   with   one   of   the   amazing   scientists, \nDr.Ganesamoorthy and Dr.K.Ganesan, who guided me throughout the project. I also got \nto saw amazing facilities like 1.7MeV tandetron, FBTR, Bhavini etc. \n \nLearning outcome: I learned a lot about crystal growth, solid state physics and material \nscience. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: Definitely  yes.  It is  course  where  we  get \nexposed to real life challenges. \n \n-------------"

Thin films are well known for their \napplication  in  the  semiconductor  industry.  In  this  project,  thin film  deposition  process \nwas  demonstrated  by  using  DC  sputtering  (a  variant  of  PVD  technique)  to  sputter \ndeposit  a  thin  Au  film  on  glass  substrate.  The  surface  topography  of  Au  thin  film  was \ninvestigated  using  Atomic  Force  Microscopy  (AFM).  AFM  is  a  type  of Scanning  probe \nmicroscopy  (SPM)  which  can  be  used  to  probe  and  investigate  the  surface  at  nano \nscale.  AFM  consists  of  a  cantilever  with  a  sharp  tip  (probe)  at  its  end  that  is  used  to \nscan the film surface. According to the nature of the tip motion AFM can be operated in \ntwo modes – semi contact and contact mode. Basic surface properties such as surface \ntopography, surface roughness, average grain distribution, average grain size, etc. can \nbe  investigated  using  AFM.  Apart  from  Au  sample,  samples  of  pyrolytic  graphite, \nNiNbTa alloy and Si-Ge were investigated using semi contact and contact mode. Apart \nfrom the basic investigations, AFM can also be used to probe electrical properties at the \nsame  scale.  Spreading  Resistance  Imaging  (SRI)  is  a  special  case  of  contact  mode \nwhere  a  conducting  probe  tip  is  used  to  map  electrical  properties  like  resistance \nmapping,  current  mapping,  etc.  SRI  is  used  to  study  the  inhomogeneity  in  electrical \nproperties  of  non  insulating  thin  films.  Au-Si  and  HOPG  samples  were  investigated \nusing SRI and mapping of their electrical properties was obtained. \n \nPS-I  experience: My  experience  at  IGCAR,  Kalpakkam  was  very  nice  and  full  of \nlearning.  I  got  the  chance  to  have  a first hand  experience  about  how  research  work  is \ndone  in  the  field  of  science.  All  the  scientists  working  at  centre  were  humble, \napproachable   and   very   knowledgeable.   They   were   always   ready   to   share   their \nknowledge  with  us. We  were  flooded  with  a  lot  of  projects  to  choose  from  on  the  very \nfirst day.  It was a delightful experience to choose a project of my choice and work on it \nwhole heartedly. The project work was challenging but exciting. PS-I really gave me an \nopportunity  to  dive  into  the  world  of  academia.  Under  the  guidance  of  my  mentor  I \nsuccessfully  completed  my  project and  presented  the  results  in  front  of  the  expert \ncommittee. \nSo, PS-I not only gave me an opportunity to work on a good project but also helped me \nto utilize my summer break in the most efficient manner. \n \n \nLearning outcome: My project was focused on metal and semiconductor thin films and \ntheir  characterization  using  Atomic  force  microscope  in  contact  mode,  semi  contact \nmode and spreading resistance imaging (SRI) mode. A thin film is defined as a layer of \nmaterial of thickness ranging from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers. The \n\n141 \n \nthin  film  deposition  techniques  can  be  broadly  classified  into  two  categories:  Physical \nVapor  Deposition  (PVD)  that  utilizes  the  physical  movement  of  particles  and  Chemical \nVapor Deposition (CVD) that utilizes a chemical reaction. Basic surface properties such \nas  surface  topography,  surface  roughness,  average  grain  distribution,  average  grain \nsize, etc. can be investigated using AFM in contact and semi contact mode. SRI mode \nwhich uses a conducting tip is used to study the inhomogeneity in electrical properties \nof  non  insulating  thin films.  SRI  mode  is  also  used  to  characterize  electrical properties \nlike current mapping, resistance, conductance, etc. of a thin film. \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course: PS-I is really an exposure oriented course. PS-I \nprovided  us  a  platform  to  bridge  the  gap  between  academia  and  industry.

This  course  does  not  only  helps  us  develop  academically  but  also  helps  in \noverall   personality   development.   The   numerous   group   discussions   and   project \npresentations helped me develop my soft skills as well as improve my public speaking \nwhich I always was afraid of. All this added to my personality development and growth \nof my character. Also, the numerous official visits to nuclear power plants, test reactors, \ndifferent research centres and labs, control rooms, water desalination plants were very \nfruitful and exposed us to application of science in real world. \n \n-------------"

In ISRO Inertial Systems Unit, we were  given the task of analyzing the kinematics \nand  dynamics  of  the  SSR  (Smart  Space  Robot)  arm.  We  were  required  to  find  the \nreachable points of the arm and the power requirements of the motors. The SSR (Smart \nSpace  Robot)  is  to  be  launched from  the fourth  stage  of PSLV  (Polar  Satellite  Launch \nVehicle) to take pictures, perform pick and place operations and then dock itself back to \nthe docking platform. We needed to ensure its smooth motion in space. \nAs robotics was a new field to us, Dr. Joji Chaman (Group Director MDPG)  gave us a \nbook- “Introduction to Robotic Mechanisms and Control by John J Craig”, so that we get \nenough insight in this field. Another book from which we studied was “Theory of Applied \nRobotics” by Reza N. Jazar.  We studied the kinematics and dynamics of a robot from \nthese  books.  After  that,  we  implemented  the  motion  and  forces  on  the  SSR  arm  on \nMATLAB. This task needed verification through simulation in Adams software. Through \nconstant  guidance  of  our  mentors  (especially,  Mr.  Dileep)  and  team  effort,  we  were \nfinally able to verify the joint torques. The next step was to perform arm aided docking \nmaneuvers  of  the  SSR.  We  explored  all  the  possible  ways  of  docking  and  had  some \nunconventional  ideas.  But  we  discarded  these  ideas  after  we  did  a  feasibility  study \nwhich  concluded,  that  arm-aided  docking  was  risky  due  to  the  presence  of  only  two \njoints  in  the  arm.  The  SSR’s  motion was  thoroughly  analyzed  to  come  to  this \nconclusion.  \nThen we moved on to achieve perfect control of the SSR so that it doesn’t experience \nany  force  or  torque  while  performing  any  maneuvers.    After,  solving  the  governing \nequations we found out that the forces and torques cannot be balanced simultaneously \ndue to various design constraints. But our mentor appreciated our work and asked us to \nbalance  the  torque  only  and  assured  us  that  the  design  constraints  will  be  removed. \nAnd  after  that,  we  successfully  implemented  the  torque  balance  equation.  At  our \nworkplace, we also got the opportunity to meet other interns. An intern from NIT-Calicut \nwas  working  on  the  gripper  part  of  the  arm.  And  other  interns  from  CET  (College  of \nEngineering  Trivandrum)  are  going  to  implement  our  work.  We  also  met  Mr.  Gaurav \nBehrani who was working on the SSR project in 2018. He gave us some useful tips and \nsome  of  us  helped  him  out  in  the  Optical  Encoder  project  which  he  is  currently \nundertaking.   After   doing   this   project,   we   now   have   knowledge   about   an   arm's \nkinematics  (reachable  points  or  we  can  say  workspace  of  the  arm)  and  dynamics \n(torques required to do a maneuver). \n \n\n153 \n \n \nPS-I experience: The people working in ISRO are open-minded and are ready to take \nnew  ideas. They  are  very  encouraging.  Even  the employees  working  there  would  help \nus out if we encounter some problems. We presented our work to Dr. Joji and then the \nElectrical students from CET. Dr. Joji applauded us for our work and encouraged us to \nfurther explore this field in the future. Due to limited amount of time we were not able to \nperform stress analysis on the SSR arm and were not able to work on control part of the \nrobot. Although being a government research lab ISRO has many restrictions (we were \nnot allowed to use the internet at ISRO and to bring our phone inside!), still it is one of \nthe best places to pursue cutting edge projects. \n \nLearning  outcome: At  ISRO  we  learned  how  space  robotics  is  an  interdisciplinary \nsubject  which  requires  the  culmination  of  both  mechanical  and  electrical  engineering. \nWe  also  learned  about  the  design  of  an  optical  encoder  and  made  a  virtual  optical \nencoder  which  helped  Mr.  Gaurav  in  removing  the  eccentric  error  in  a  real  optical \nencoder.

In  the  first  2  weeks  we  were  told  to  establish  a  state-of-art  in \nour  respective  fields.  For  that  we  had  to  undertake  a  literature  survey  which  would \nreveal what all has been done in the field already. Then we had to submit it to Arnab sir,  \nthe  founder  director  of  MRC,  pune.  He  then  suggested  us  some  changes  which  we \nincorporated  in  our  research  note.  After  that  the real  work  began  in  our  project  i.e  the \nwork that would be our original work then began.I had to list down the components that \nare there in the ships, which was actually the part of the literature survey. Then I had to \nfigure out the different regimes of operation for those components for the ships and this \nis  to  be  used  as  a  framework  to  future  experiments.  For  this, I  had  to  take  help  from \noutside as recommended to me by Dr. Arnab Das and hence I then contacted Mr. Yezdi \nBatliwala  through  mail  and  received  the  necessary  help  from  him. Then, finally  I  listed \ndown the steps for the making of the algorithm for automatic report generation which is \na future scope of my project. \n \nPS-I experience: It was a very enjoyable experience. The work environment was very \nfriendly  and  contributed  a  lot  to  me  getting  addicted  to  my  work  and  that  place  itself. \nOverall, it was a great experience and a hugely useful exposure to the outside world. \n \nLearning  outcome: I  now  have  a  lot  more  knowledge  on  ships  and  navy  than  I  had \nwhen a started. Now, I understand the importance of oceans and why and how they are \nto be protected and used to our advantage. \n\n212 \n \n \nPS-I is an exposure oriented course: It is an apt statement. We got exposure to what \nkind of environment actually exists in any organization. We also got an exposure to how \nto  work  as  a  team  and  accept  your  colleagues  the  way  they  are  and  getting  used  to \nwhatever is there. So, I think the statement aptly explains what goes on in the practice \nschool. \n \n-------------"

One of \nthe biggest problem in learning from mentors was that they were mostly unavailable and \nwere not able to devote their time to us either because they were busy in their work or \nthey were on leave. \n \nLearning outcome: I got to learn about the whole cement manufacturing process. \nWhat are MSW and RDF? \nWhat problems do the Indian Cement Industry faces in their implementation in cement \nkilns? \nWhat are the impacts of co-processing of RDF in a cement plant on energy,process and \nenvironment? \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: I  got  an  exposure  to  how  an  organisation \nfunctions and how different departments collaborate together to perform a task. \n \n------------- \n\n178"

Noting down the NC's (Non Conformities) during the \nsite  visit and preparing  a report at the end of the visit. Also, preparing a monthly report \nat  the end  of  every  month. The  nature  of  work  was  inspection  of electrical  work  at  the \nvarious sites,taking notes and tracking  the latest developements and weather the NC's \n(non  conformities)  pointed  out  are  being  complied  to  or  not.  Thus  increasing  the \nefficiency  and productivity of thye various electrical machinery being installed and used \nat the sites. NC are created when the measurements or readings are not in accordance \nwith the BoQ (Bill of Quantity) provided by  the first party (the organisation which gives \nthe contract to a contractor for electrical works). NC's are also created when the reading \nor measurements are not in accordance with government manuals such as the CPWD \nmanual and the SIB. The Project revolved around the procedure of TPQA (Third Party \nQuality  Assurance)  which  includes    inspection  of  various  electrical  works  at  sites.  It \ngenerally involves measurement of values such as resistances and voltages like in the \nearth  resistance  test.  This  might  require  devices  like  ground  clamp  meter,voltmeter  or \ninstruments  like  inch  tape,vernier  calliper  or  just  counting  the  number  of  wires  or \nconduits.  The  non-conformities  are  then  noted  down  and  given  a  unique  number  and \npresented in a daily / monthly report. \n \nPS-I   experience: PS-I experience   was   definitely   a   memorable   one,   I   learnt   a \nlot,knowledge  that  will  be  put  to  use  in  the  remaining  years  of  my  engineering  and \nfurther. This was my first experience in a corporate setup and i had the opportunity to go \nto various construction sites varying n sizes across Delhi NCR and do electrical TPQA. \n \nLearning  outcome: I  learnt  about  various  electrical  devices  such  as  DG  sets,  LT \nPanels,  HVAC's,  Cable  Trunk  Management  Systems,  AHU's,  Chillers,  Cable  trays, \ncables,  junction  points  etc.  Their  working, installation  and  how  to  do  a  comprehensive \nTPQA for them. How to overcome any NC, thus the correctrive measure for them. I also \nlearnt how to compile reports. Lastly, i had to prepare the PS report where i could use \nmy report making skills. Giving presentation also shot up my confidence levels and put \nmy public speaking skills to test. \n \nPS-I  is  an  exposure  oriented  course: Yes,  PS-I is  definitely  an  expousure  oriented \ncourse.  Firstly,it  provides  expousure  to  the  corporate  world, how  things  work,  reports \nand presentations. For me it meant a lot more than that, I learnt about TPQA and could \ngo to various sites and actually make a difference because of the immense expousure. \n \n------------- \n\n179"
