Process behavior in the \naluminum smelting  industry  is  typically  highly  dynamic  and  unstable  and  involves  non-linear,  highly \ndimensional  relationships  among  process  parameters.  Therefore,  a  control  algorithm  is  required  to \nstabilize the performance of the reduction cell. Therein lies the importance of avoiding or reducing the \nharmful effects by taking appropriate actions early enough, in the view of various time lags such as the \ndelay caused by the time required to dissolve the alumina into the bath. Time series predictive modeling \nis  the  one  of  the  method  to  control  the  anode  effects.  We  can  maintain  the  required  alumina \npercentage in the bath. We used Matlab for this Project and successfully developed a predictive model \nfor aluminum smelter. i used neural network for this project.  \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Matlab, Scilab, Microsoft Excel, Python \nObjectives  of  the  project: Development  of  a  predictive  process  control  model  using  machine  learning \ntool (such as neural network)  to forecast  pot response  and also identify the optimal operating window \nfor aluminium smelter operation at lower specific energy. \n\nOutcomes of the project: So this predictive model will help in energy saving by predicting odd behavior \nlike  anode  effect  and  sludge  formation.  As  this  model  is  able  to  replicate  the  behavior  of  existing  cell \noutput on the basis of dump. So we can predict the resistance on the basis of dump \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Basic  Programming  in  Matlab  and  Python.

It  provides  monitoring  and  management  of  cloud  application.  Autodesk's  Fusion360  Team \nproduct  has  basic  NewRelic  integration  helping  to  do  health  monitoring.  My  project  was  aimed  to \ncapture  more  functional  and  non-functional analytical  data  and  publish  to NewRelic,  as  new  metrics. \nThese  metrics  can  help  in  bringing  in-depth  visibility  of  the  product's  health,  user  behavior,  detect \nanomalies  and perform real-time diagnostics. The metrics are pushed to NewRelic using it's Java Agent \nAPI, from various integration points in Fusion360 Team product.. \n\nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Vagrant, IntelliJ, Java8, Ant, MySQL \nObjectives of the project: Project was aimed to improve the monitoring and management capabilities of \nNewRelic to find the errors in path, performance bottenecks and other issues more efficiently. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Autodesk  has  now  better  insight  to  their  application.  It  can  monitor  it's \nbackground  jobs  that  are  significant  part  of  the  application.  They  have  more  information  related  to  a \nrequest  to  debug  the  issue  helping  them  relating  the  request  in  multiple  monitoring  tools  and  desired \ncustom metrics from database regarding their offline jobs to monitor the health of their webapp. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The experience at Autodesk is one that has proved to be more practical than \nanything else taught academically. It has been brilliantly enlightening in the sense that any student who \nwishes  to  experience  the  real  application  of  his/her  learning  during  his/her  career  can  do  that  on  the \nPractice  School  2.  It  can  be specially  helpful  to  those  who  wish  to  decide  on  a  career  path  by  getting \nactual experience. During my internship period at Autodesk, I learnt a whole lot of stuff including major \ntechnologies, communication skills and management skills. The technologies include Spring Framework, \nGradle and Ant, Design Patterns, Database Transactions, major modelling techniques etc. , which are not \nusually taught in the academic syllabus. There is a difference in writing simple code and creating useful \nclient based services by coding and this one difference was the highlight of my stay at Autodesk. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: My  experience  at  my \nAutodesk  Hyderabad,  involved  complete  and  overall  industrial  exposure  to  the  corporate  IT  lifestyle. \nThere were no office timings, and the choice of my office timings was left up to me. In the long run, this \ninstilled a sense of responsibility in me, since I was responsible for my working hours and completing the \ntasks  given  to  me  in  the  span  of  those  hours.  Additionally,  all  the  projects  I  had  done  in  college  had \nnever  been tested  in  a  practical environment,  by  actual  users.
