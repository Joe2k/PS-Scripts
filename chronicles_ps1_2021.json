A  case  in  point  being  the  work  that  goes  on  in  a  corporate  team \nwhere  everyone  has  to  make  their  timely  contributions  to  keep  things  functioning \nsmoothly. This served as a good introduction to what one should expect if they take the \ncorporate career path. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: The experience from PS1 included technical learning outcomes in \nworking with python and more specifically plone and the zope object database. PS1 was \nalso a great exercise in the whole process of documenting your work which was highly \nstressed upon by both, the industry mentor and the faculty mentor.  \nLearning outcomes in terms of soft skills included getting used to constant presentations \nand  meetings  with  senior  personnel  in  the  organization,  which  definitely  improved  my \ncommunication  skills  and  also  my  comfort  levels  in  such  an  environment  which  some \nmight define as stressful. \n \n \n------------"

Our project's objective \nwas to create and publish a module that provides a 3D model of the human body or its \nparts that can be edited according to the user in real-time and with ease. The prime focus \nbehind this project was to solve the problems faced by the doctors while illustrating their \npatients in online mode.  \nOur  approach  was  divided  into  four  steps.  At  first,  we  started  off  with  building  a  basic \ndemo   on   CodePen   using   the   KonvaJS   library.   Initially,   basic   2D   shapes   were \nimplemented, followed by transformers to change size and cleaning options concluding \nwith image upload and download functions. In the second step, we shifted to the Angular \nframework to manage our web app better. The next critical step was shifting to 3D. In the \nbeginning,  we  started  to  create  fundamental  models  and  tried  various  features  of  3D \nobject  rendering.  After  that,  we  picked  BabylonJs  library  to  work  upon,  and  imported \nvarious external 3D models, and added camera control to it so that different parts of the \nmodel  could  be  accessed.  After  creating  and  testing  different  functionality  of  the  two \nlibraries, KonvaJs and BabylonJs, we created a final component by integrating both the \nimplementations into a single module, and this project was finally published as a package \nusing Node Package Manager. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was a great learning experience. The period of the last two months \nwas exciting and taught us a lot, from technical skills to soft skills. Though I could not take \ncomplete  advantage  of  the  Practice  School  due  to  the  online  mode,  it  was  a  rich \nexperience overall. I got some exposure to the corporate world and learned how things \nwork  in  the  IT  industry  and  the  work  culture.  The  most  important  skill  that  I  learned  is \n\n67 \n \naccepting  challenges  and manage  our  workflow  to  reach  the  goal  despite  some \nunavoidable  situations  that might  arise.  Mentors  were  also  very  supportive  and  helped \nme wherever needed. Working as a team and brainstorming to solve a problem was fun \nand exciting altogether. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I  learned  various  technical  skills  like  front-end  web  development, \nuse of different libraries for different purposes, Angular framework. These skills are highly \nneeded in IT industries nowadays. Apart from technical skills, I learned communication \nand presentation skills, maintaining work life balance, and accepting challenges given by \nthe organization and completing them in the the given time despite unavoidable situations \nthat  might  arise.  Above  all,  I  got  an  exposure  to  the  work  culture  of  IT  industries  and \nlearned to achieve bigger goals by working together as a team. \n \n \n------------"

What I did was reviewed the existing literature on the \ntopic and learnt about a useful and popularly used cost based technique called \"Earned \n\n99 \n \nValue Analysis\", It is one useful tool for project managers but to use it one needs to have \na Work Breakdown Structure, a pre-defined work schedule, and that is what precisely my \nproject aims to do, as I use the data from successfully completed past projects to model \na general timeline for projects of a particular kind in railways, and hence providing a model \nthat empowers project managers to save huge chunks of time and money. The data part \nof the problem is a two step process, as first, one needs to label all the completed projects \ninto successful or less than successful ones, I use the data on target date of completion \nand actual date of completion and study the series of their difference to come up with this \nlabelling,  using  various  outlier  detection  algorithms  ,  The  second  step  involves  the \npredictive modelling, using only the successful completed projects data and regressing a \nphysical progress indicator with time from start of project to come up with the final project \nschedule. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  filled  with  challenges  and  learning,  for  the  first  time  I  got  the \nopportunity to get the hands dirty on an actual Data Analytics use case right from scratch \nand this is when I got to realise that it is getting and refining the data that is the harder (or \nalmost as hard) part than training the algorithms. The online nature of it while allowed for \na lot of flexibility for me to complete the work at my convenience, also came with a lot of \nchallenges as the interaction with my mentor was at a bare minimum and establishing a \nrapport with an unknown person over audio calls is far from efficient, so I was left to handle \nmost of the project problems on my own and the expectations were good enough from \ntheir side.

We  were  promised  Strategy  and  Business \nDevelopment  Role  but  were  mainly  given  work  of  content  writing,  publicity,  graphic \ndesigning, and sales. In our first interaction with the company we were told to be parts of \nclient meeting and to teach how market works and understanding of the business model.  \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Teamwork,  Understanding  the  potential  clients  of  the  company, \nUnderstanding the working of LinkedIn profiles of companies and content they create for \ntheir page, How to organically increase followers of company‘s LinkedIn page, What \nshould be the level of post that can be posted on the company’s LinkedIn account, \nAnalyzing how other companies are maintaining their LinkedIn profile, We also learned \nbasics of Canva on which we did Graphic Designing for our posts. \n \n \n------------"

The major problem in the industry is the limited amount \nof  data  available  due  to  the  newness  of  the  industry.  The  consumers  in  the cannabis \nindustry use it for different purposes and due to a large variety of  products available it \nbecomes  even  more  crucial  to  suggest  right  products  to the  customer  in  order  to  gain \ntheir trust in the brand and to increase the value of the business. To respect the privacy \nof the customers the customers records are deleted after they have placed an order so it \nfurther adds to the challenge as there is no past record of the customer and in order to \nmain the relation with the customer we need to provide them the best experience \npossible.

Since their is no \ninformation  available  about  the  customers  that  are  new  to  the  business  they can  be \nrecommended  products  on  the  basis  of  the  trending  products  on  the  basis  of  data \ncollected from last 7 days, or on the basis of products that are commonly purchased in \ntheir locality. They can also be recommended products on the basis of the items in the \nbasket and recommending them products that are often bought with that. All these can \nbe used to recommend products to an existing customer as well but since he have past \norder history of the customer we can also use that to suggest products on the basis of the \nproducts bought by the customer or other lookalike customers in the past. Though, there \nare multiple ways to provide recommendation system, the system which takes care of the \nneeds of all types of customer is a hybrid recommendation system which builds upon the \nbenefits  of  other  systems  thereby  taking  care  of  the  disadvantages  faced  in  each \nrecommendation system. \n \n \n------------"

Overall, the task undertaken by us was highly impactful in the way \nthat we  were able to channel down the time of managing team in some other productive \ntasks rather than manual updation tasks which are boring and error-prone at the same \ntime. \n \n \nPS-I experience: If I had to describe it in a sentance then I would say that it was well \nabove expectations. The most important thing at any corporate is a work culture and I can \ndefinitely say that it was one of the best to get our balls rolling in the world of corporates. \nSecondly, the delegated tasks were good enough to picked up at a faster pace and match \nthe  frequency  of  deployment  of  the  main  team  as  well.  Furthermore,  the  best  thing  at \nHabbit was the environment and team we had. It was one of the most vibrant and lively \nenvironment that anyone can get at a station. It always felt like working with a bunch of \nfriends  on  releasing  a  product  or  rolling  in  a  new  feature.  Last  but  not  the  least,  since \nHabbit  was  a  start-up  in  its  early  days  with  a    comparatively  smaller  team,  I  also \ncontributed in some tasks outside the domain and helped me to get insights on working \nof other departments and startups as a whole too. \n \n \n\n156 \n \nLearning Outcome: The  learning  outcomes  from  this  7  week  stay  at  Habbit  was \nsomething  very  significant.  From  being  a  newbie  in  the  field  of  development,  not  even \nknowing python, to rolling out some features directly into production on my own was the \nsummary of my learnings.I picked up a bunch of skills that will stay with me throughout \nthe initial days of my career which includes formal communication, collaborative coding \nand writing up corporate level code. Won't exxagerate but from shifting a complete OS to \nraising first PR to finally fixing some bugs gave some real thrill that I never imagined of. \nOverall it was a sea of learnings for me. More you explore, more you learn! \n \n \n------------"

The script \nnot only has easy-to-draw and straightforward glyphs but is also unique in the sense that \nno glyphs and their transformations (mirror images and rotations) are ever repeated in it. \nWe identified the missing gaps in the naYana script and made new glyphs and ligatures \nto fill those gaps. Once the entire English and Hindi sounds were covered within naYana, \na keyboard through Keyman as an input mechanism was developed that can empower \nthe users worldwide to enter naYana glyphs through their standard Latin keyboards. An \ninteractive  webpage  where  people  can  get  their  hands  dirty  and  get  familiar  with  the \nmapping in a fun way was also published. The project has also successfully delivered a \nbrowser plugin that can render complete web pages and selected text into naYana, thus \nmaking the script more accessible to large audiences. This required the creation of an \n\n183 \n \nAPI that makes use of Epitran library to give the IPA equivalent of the requested English \nor  Hindi  string  as  a  response.  The  browser  plugin  was  made  for  Chrome  and  Firefox \nbrowsers  and  was  tested  in  several  test-cases  in  both  the  browsers.  The  interactive \nwebpage and the Keyman keyboard was also tested to check for correct functioning. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  PS-1  served  as  a  great  learning  tool  for  me  as  I  was  able  to \nunderstand the work environment better. The people working at HBCSE were extremely \nhelpful and were very resourceful as well. They were able to help my group whenever we \ngot  stuck  at  a  problem.  Our  mentor  allowed  us  to  choose  our  projects  and  was  very \nflexible even after a concrete problem statement was chosen by us. This allowed us to \ngo further beyond the scope of the first problem statement that we had chosen and I am \nhappy that I was able to make something that will be useful for the station within the time \nlimit. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Learnt a lot about the creation of a new script and the challenges \nbehind it. Understood how to do web development efficiently in a group. Now I have good \nconfidence in my HTML, CSS and JS skills. Learnt how an API is built using web2py and \npython-anywhere server and how to make use of an API using JS and Postman. \n \n \n------------"

We  extended  the  mapping  that  already  existed  to  be  inclusive  of  many \nmore IPA symbols and languages that was possible earlier.  \nWe even developed a naYana playground webpage with a JS dictionary for solving the \nchallenge of an input mechanism so that users could input naYana using their standard \nLatin keyboards. A keyman keyboard was also developed as an alternative solution for \nthe same challenge. \nHowever the major deliverable of the project was a browser plugin - naYana Scribe for \nGoogle  Chrome  and  Mozilla  Firefox  that  can  transliterate  complete  webpages  into  the \nnaYana  script.  We  even  developed  and integrated  our  own  backend  server  for  this \nextension using web2py framework and hosted it on pythonanywhere. \n \n \n\n184 \n \nPS-I experience: I had an amazing experience in my PS-1.

Our  primary  mentor was  extremely \nknowledgable and provided various valuable inputs to our work. \nAlso, the station is quite open to all the domains and didn't limit itself to the domains that \nwere present while filling our PS preferences. They gave complete flexibility to choose \nour own projects and guided on how to refine the problem statement.  \nSo overall, it was a great experience and I will wholeheartedly recommend this station to \nall the next batches. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: We learnt about various frameworks and libraries. We even got a \ntouch of how the fonts are actually designed and used the fontforge software to design \nour  own  glyphs  as  well. We also  learnt how  to  develop an extension for  browsers  and \nhow to setup and host your own servers for some simple applications.  \nApart from the technical stuff, it is needless to say that the PS1 enhances our communical \nskills and presentation skills to much greater heights. Developing and presenting are two \ndifferent fortes and we learnt to master them both in this journey. \n \n \n------------"

Being  COVID  as  the  most \nchallenging thing humanity is currently facing, working to get solutions for the people was \nvery  motivating  and  helpful.  There  was  a  sudden  change  of  leadership  of  the  team  in \nbetween which slightly threw off the team productivity but eventually, it got back in track.  \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I was able to understand how Data Annotation is done with Label \nMe  and  understood  a  lot  of  stuff  that  is  required  to  even  start  a  project.  The \ndocumentation,  youtube  videos  and  research  papers  recommended  by  the  team  lead  \nwere very helpful for understanding. Even after being a beginner, I was able to develop a \n\n209 \n \nsimple model for the team achieving an accuracy of 94%. Due to scaricity of time, I wasn't \nable to develop the wireframe yet overall it was a good experience. \n \n \n------------"

LaserTrac  is  Laser  Speed  Cameras  developed  by Integra \nDesign.  LaserTrac  cameras  are  used  for  tracing  cars  and  other  vehicles  for  traffic \nenforcement purposes. LaserTrac cameras can detect the speed and type of the vehicle \netc. They have an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system in them, which \nenables them to automatically detect the number plate of a vehicle in the video. With this \nfeature, we can automatically capture the number plate of any vehicle, which breaks traffic \nrules  like  a  red  light  violation,  speed  limit  exceeds,  etc.  LaserTrac  cameras  capture  a \nsnapshot every  time  a  vehicle  violates  any  traffic  rule. The traffic  police  or  the  camera \noperator can then go through the snapshots and generate chalan for the violation. Chalan \nhas the number plate of the vehicle, the snapshot of the violation, and some other useful \ninformation about the violation and the vehicle. \nCurrently,  these  LaserTrac  cameras  have  their  application  built  using  C#,  and  it  is \nimplemented in a Windows based system.

I  was \nresponsible  for  testing  the  app  on  various  devices  to  check  it's  responsiveness.  I  also \nhelped in making the logo of the app and various bug fixing in the application. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The experience was moderate. Though the project was good but we \ndidn't had a technical mentor since KEF is an NGO. So we had to do and plan all the work \nby ourselves. Also, the KEF team was suggesting new features into the application mid-\nway  which we denied since we already built the foundation of the application. Though, \nthe PS mentors were good and understanding. Also we applied for a Web development \nproject but were given App development. It is difficult to make an App from scratch such \nthat it is deployable on the play store in 1.5 months. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: With  sheer  hardwork,  I  learnt  JavaScript  language,  React  Native \nframework, Figma for UI design,  NodeJS for backend, deploying an app on Heroku. \n \n \n------------"

The  project's  objective  is  to  outline  an  application  that \n\n223 \n \nenables students and youth to communicate effectively in their day-to-day lives and in a \nprofessional environment. \nKeeping in mind the organization's primary focus, i.e., for the underprivileged audience, \nthe app would help them speak English confidently. The app has to be simple enough to \nbe comprehended by vernacular speakers. \nThe first stage of the app development was to conduct market research of the popular \nlanguage learning apps and extract their USPs and features. The features included UI/UX \nand Design, Gamification aspects, presence of any AI/ML. \nThe  second  stage  of  the  app  development  required  creating  a  blueprint  using  market \nresearch  as  a  base,  including  selecting  the  best  out  of  all  available  options  like \ngamification aspects, UI/UX design, and AI/ML features. \nThe  third  stage  of  the  app  development  required  wireframing,  which  was  to  be  done \nkeeping in mind the target audience. It was done using Balsamiq, which provided the app \nwith a logical flow and gave it a concrete structure. The wireframe or mockup had two \ninterfaces, which included creating an interface for learners while the other interface was \nfor the teachers. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  had  a  good  experience  working  with  my  PS  station.

Our  end  goal  was  to  make  a  model  to \nsuggest a shipment carrier based on the origin and destination for a package. Data was \nprovided to us in a large JSON file which we loaded into Jupyter Notebooks for analysis. \nWe cleaned up the missing and null values in the dataset, and explored Python libraries \nlike Pandas and Matplotlib to carry out analysis and visualizations on a large data base. \nWe  explored  the  Google  Maps  API  to  geocode  the  address  locations  and  to  create  a \ndistance  matrix.  We  used  machine  learning  algorithms  like  K-means  clustering  and \nDBSCAN  to  simplify  the  dataset.  We  performed  carrier  specific  and  location  specific \nanalysis  to  gain  key  insights  on  the  dataset.  We  created  a  spreadsheet  of  all  the  past \ncarrier  data  of  the  company  in  such  a manner  as  to  obtain  the  carrier  performance for \nvarious carriers in the dataset between a set of locations visually.

The overall aim of the project was to analyze the marine ambient \nnoise data from a water body and draw meaningful conclusions from it. First, I employed \ndifferent windowing techniques to understand their effect on the signal to be analyzed. \nCalculating power spectrums, analyzing noise data with surrounding weather conditions \nwere some of those. The average noise levels computed provided the cumulative noise \nlevels produced by biotic and abiotic activities such as localized fishing boat movements. \nThe computed standard deviation for the data with respect to Beaufort Scale has shown \nexponential fall in noise levels as the wind speed is increased resulting in production of \nambient  noise  at  higher  frequencies.  Finally,  I  tried  to  isolate  the  biotic  noise  from \n\n279 \n \nrecordings and tried to identify the fish species which were generating the noise mainly. I \nobserved  that  in  the  part  of  the  Arabian  sea  where  I  obtained  the  signals,  most  of  the \nnoise was generated by the Crawford fish, a specie that mainly feeds on sea urchins in \nthe  sea  bed.    There  is  scope  for  further  improvements  in  the  project,  such  as  more \ndetailed classification of biotic and abiotic noise and using advanced techniques for signal \nprocessing. \n \n \nPS-I experience: I had a very good experience mainly because i was lucky to have two \nvery  helpful  people  to  guide  me  whenever  I  had  a  difficulty - my  PS  mentor  and  my \nindustry  mento.  Dr.  Sandeep  Joshi  was  very  inspiring  and  he  ensured  that  we  had    a \nsustained passion to work on our project and hopefully obtain a publication to our name. \nHe was always free to clarify any doubts we had - be it in the evaluation components or \nbe it in seeking help to write up our final report. He was a key reason why we were able \nto learn such completely new things with confidence. Mr. William was also very helpful \nand the occasional earful I heard from him was very important because without that, the \ncontent I would have written in my report would be less than satisfactory. He was also \nvery flexible and caring - i especially remember how he allowed me to push a deadline to \nfinish  a  certain  objective  of  my  project  for  later  since  I  was  due  to  get  the  COVID \nvaccination  that  day.  NIO  also  must  not  be forgotten. Even  amidst  the  pandemic,  they \nwere very professional and always enquired about our project's progress - especially Mr. \nThavapandian (the HRM) . I very much enjoyed every bit and the only thing that is a sort \nof  negative  would  be  the  inability to  visit  the  station.  Overall,  I really  enjoyed  the \nexperience and I hope the coming batches also have an experience like I did. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: They were many learning outcomes and i shall list them one by one: \n1) I learnt that for PSD - Welch's method is the best technique in comparison to the FFT \nmethod since  Welch’s method can smooth over non-systematic noise and overall signal \ndoesn't get affected - showing how robust a technique it is vis-a-vis FFT method.  \n2) On analyzing the wind speed data and plotting vs atmospheric pressure, I learnt ow  \natmospheric pressure supports high wind speeds. \n3)Plotting wind speeds(in terms of Beaufort Scale) vs frequency -  the suppression  \nof noise level at higher frequencies takes place. \n4) Most of the marine ambient noise is produced by schools of fish and that generally the \nhydrophones that record the sound must be subjected to pressure corrections to obtain \nan adequate signal for PSD analysis. \nOn  a  more  personal  note  and not  professional- I  learnt  that  being  hardworking  and \npassionate about things you really want to learn takes you to levels of commitment and \nexcellence that you wouldn't imagine you cold achieve. \n \n \n------------ \n\n280"

We plan on taking the project to the next stage with an end-to-\nend pipeline deployed, possibly using AWS. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  faculty  mentor was  quite  understanding  in  nature and  provided \nguidance whenever needed. My industry mentor made it possible for us to learn new skills \nand  suggested  workarounds  to  cope  up  with  the  shortcomings  of  working  in  an  online \nmode. Overall it was a fun and engaging experience. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Although I was a bit familiar with the theoretical aspect of Machine \nLearning / Deep Learning, I realized the importance of inference servers such as Triton, \nthat make deployment and management easier. I also learnt how to use Docker to set up \nsoftware efficiently,  making  it  easier  for  other  developers  to  join  the  work.  Moreover,  I \nrealized how important teamwork is. \n \n \n------------"

The process started with scouting \ndifferent  frameworks.  Taking  various  factors  into  account  as  well  as  reviews,  this  was \nfollowed by the exploration of MLFlow and the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. \nWhile  Triton  was  difficult  to  set  up,  and  interact  with,  MLFlow  fell  short  of  our  needs, \nrequiring various other platforms to support it for functionality. The use of Triton involved \nsetting  up  repositories,  model files,  and  configuration  files  that  varied  with  the  model \nbackend and structure.  \nWe  would  incorporate  the  implementation  of  the  aforementioned  endpoints  in  our \nbackend  during  deployment,  along  with  error  handling  and  request  optimization.

The  work  was  assigned  to  us  every  week,  and  we  were  given \nfeedback based on the work submitted. The main tasks we were given were: Performing \ndifferent functions on the leads provided to us in an excel file, making reports on mainly \nthe salesforce services, including the competitors, user reviews, market value, etc. The \nevaluations were fun; we had a group discussion on \"Product vs Research.\" where there \nwas a good debate among the prescribed groups of students. After the discussions, our \nPS instructor teacher gave his feedback on the talks we performed. We also had different \nquizzes and report submissions for which we did extensive research on the domain we \nare working; this helped us to learn more about our domain, especially state of the art. \nOverall,  it  was  a  great  learning  experience.  It  enhanced  my  Data  Analysis  skills  and \nimproved my knowledge about Sales and Marketing in an Enterprise. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I  was  able  to  improve  my  Excel  and  R skills.  My  knowledge  of \nMarketing and Sales of an Enterprise increased manifolds. I also improved my speaking \nskills and presentation skills. The main thing I learnt was to work in a team to achieve a \ngoal in a prescribed time. As the same thing happens in any company you work. \n \n \n------------"

For this the company has given us a structured timeline where first \nwe have to do benchmarking and make a rough outline of website with presentation. Then \nwe  have  started  working  on  the  website.  We  divided  our  team  into  two- frontend  and \nbackend. So, I am in backend team and we have worked in this mainly on the data part \nof the site. We have integrated a whatsapp chatbox, design the database for log in and \nforms that are there in the website. We are contributing with the frontend team to publish \nthe website on the internet. \n \n \nPS-I experience: When I first started the work there are some nervousness in working \nthere and some worries about how the projects are going to be distributed. Do I get the \n\n331 \n \nproject I want? But these worries got fade away instantly when our PS mentors decided \nto  discard  the  business  project  and  accommodate  with  the  our  team's  wishes  and \nassigned  the  web  development  project  to  all  of  us.  After  this  there  are  some  ups  and \ndowns during working of the project but I think we did very well and or mentors have fully \nsupported  us  throughout  this  journey.  This  is  my  personal  experience  with  regard  to \nproject.  Now  I  will  like  to  describe  other  experiences  like  report  and  GDs.    Group \ndiscussion is a very good and enriching experience for me personally as I have improved \nin this area very much during the two GDs. This was a very fulfilling experience. I have \nread  about  technical  report  and  presentation  in  first  year.  This  is  the  first  time  I  got  to \nutilize these theoretical learning and converting it into practice and I learned through this \nexperience and I think I will improve more in the future. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: The learning outcomes are: \n1. Learned the proper and structured way to design the website. \n2. Learned some technical skills for designing of the website \n3. Improved presentation skills and coordination of the team \n4.

This  required  me  to  work  with  a  tech  stack  of  Node.js, \nExpress.js,  MongoDB,  and  Redis  (cache),  all  in  JavaScript.  I  had  previous  experience \nwith the tech stack as well as some projects involving building REST APIs with the same, \nso no real training was required. Throughout the course of the practice school duration, \nmy  work  involved  improving  or  adding  new  APIs  to  the  server-side  application.  All  the \n\n335 \n \nplatforms  of  the  product  (Web  frontend,  Mobile  frontend,  Web  admin  dashboard) \nconnected to the backend application to get or update data, so it is a focal point of the \nproduct as all the logic goes there. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The mentors were generally very friendly and approachable at any time, \nto clear up any doubts in the allotted work, or discuss and finalize any completed work. \nThe  product  itself  is  finance  (trading,  investments)  based,  and  I  had  very  limited \nknowledge of that. This meant that I had to contact the mentors more often to clear up \nany concepts in the code logic, and there were no issues with communication. However, \nwork on the backend side was a little limited after the halfway period, which meant that \nthere weren't too many tasks that were being allotted. They were focusing on a complete \noverhaul of the frontend, and major work was going on there. So I took the opportunity to \nstart  learning  React.js,  which  was  part  of  the  frontend  stack,  to  be  able  to  contribute. \nHowever, React is a vast library and I could not learn enough of it by the end of the last \n2 weeks that I could contribute to the frontend work, nonetheless, it has piqued my interest \nand I plan to continue learning React. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: The company itself is a startup, so working there meant that we got \nexposure to the working environment of a startup. It is not as formal as an established \ncompany, and this actually helps in the initial stages where it's important to be open to \nasking questions and interacting with the mentors. The work itself gave me experience \nwith   writing  production-ready  backend  code,  and  this  meant  learning  things  like \ndocumentation and security. Also, working with the frontend team to build and integrate \nAPIs helps in proper communication to understand what is required and the best way to \ndeliver  it,  coordinating  with  a  team.  Punctuality  is  also  something  that  comes  into  play \nwhen attending meetings regularly which decides the impression you leave on people in \nthe  company.  All  in  all,  a  healthy  experience  which  also  kept  me  generally productive \nthroughout the duration of the internship. \n \n \n------------"

She helped a lot and was always there whenever needed. My PS-\n1  experince  was  a  good  experience  with  the  brief touch  upons  to  the  new  scenario  of \nworking in the industry. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learned in the core matter about the blockchain technology. Being \na  novice  in  this  field  I  got  healthy  exposure  to  the  subject  matter  of  the  Blockchain \nTechnology  especially on  Ethereum. Then  the  most  important  learnings  were  from  the \nskill  developed  to  be  able  to  interact  with  the  working  professionals.  To  build  the \nconnections  with  them.  To  be  able  to  take  constructive  criticism.  To  be  responsible \ntowards the work allotted and to be regular in giving updates to the concern-in-charge. \n \n \n------------"

It's aim was to build Mobile autonomous cart for agriculture that is \nable to accurately identify the objects with both self-guided and Human (on ground and \nremote)  guided  capability. The  cart  would  be  used  to  collect  and  transport  crops  from \nfarms, spray pesticides and for irrigation.I worked on the objective to instruct the cart to \nmove on a central track, after detecting it. We also detected the deviation the cart might \nhave while moving, and instructed it to take turns so as to keep on the central track. The \ntechnology  used  and  project  area  was  Machine  Learning  and  Computer  Vision.  \nChallenges faced: Since the whole project requires hardware integration, which was not \npossible in a remote practice school internship, we could only work on the software part \nof the project. \n \n \nPS-I experience: At first the station introduced us to various fields of technology by taking \nwebinars. They assigned us projects and mentors almost after a month. Due to which, \nwe  couldn't  have  time  to  build  upon  the  additional  features  of  projects.  Overall  the \nexperience  was  exemplary,  because  of  interaction  with  Swecha  team,  PS  Faculty  and \nfellow  peers from  across  campuses.

Swecha team had already cloned \nand modified the version of Mozilla's Common Voice. But the website, called the Swecha \nVoice  website  needed  modifications.  These  modifications  were:  Modifying  the  Text \nCorpus, Implementing S3 proxy and collecting annonymous data from the user. I was a \npart of the Text Corpus team and our job was to extract sentences to train the machine \nlearning model. The cloned version of the website did not have enough sentences for the \nMachine  Learning  model  and  those  that  were  there  were  also  not  optimal.  Some \nsentences were too long for the user to read or had poor syntax. Modifying the text corpus \ndealt with collecting data which is optimal for both the reader and the machine learning \nmodel. \nSo we learnt about Machine Learning tools like Orange ML and data visualisation tools \nlike Apache Superset and created a model for Speech recognition system in Telugu. So \nwe built a custom function which was coded in python using Pandas library to extract only \nthose sentences that followed some constraints like no. of words, no punctuation marks \nin  between  sentences,  etc. Text  corpus for  the  website  was  taken from  'Vikasitha'  and \nsentences  were  added  to  the  website. We  also  debugged  some  of  the  issues  that  the \nSwecha voice website had with connecting to the database and deployed our modified \nversion. \n \n \nPS-I experience: We were successful in integrating the code with the Swecha common-\nvoice repository and connected with the MySQL database. We were able to extract the \nsentences which were inline with some constraints. The last week was a little hectic but \nit  was  fun  working  with everyone  else  as  a  team  and  overcoming  all  the  challenges \ntogether to finish the project. We learnt how to work as a team and Practice School has \ndefinitely helped all of us to improve our technical as well as communication skills. I myself \ndid not know much about python but this project led me to learn Python and then write a \ncustom program which would help the team with the subtasks provided to us. Everyone \nin Text Corpus team as well as the other two teams worked together and helped each \nother whenever any of us needed help in understanding the code or writing the code etc. \nIt was because of the contribution of every single person in the team that we were able \nto successfully build the machine learning model for Text Collection. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: learnt more  about  Python,  explored  various  libraries  such  as \nPandas, CSV, CSVFiles, learnt about machine learning tools such as OrangeML and data \n\n373 \n \nvisualisation  tools  like  Apache  Superset  etc.  Also  learnt  how  to  work  with  MySQL \ndatabases. \n \n \n------------"

It stores the articles from different trustworthy \nwebsites in database and using  the it will do fact check. Our team introduced an idea of \nusing Text Summarization for correlation between sentences. The basic idea of using text \nsummarization  is to  extract  summary  out  of  the  article’  s  before  we  store  them  in \nSOLR(search engine + database) and then store the summary along with the article in \nSOLR.  whenever  a  user  comes  in  and  enter  some  text  we  will  search  it  through  the \nsummary  along  with  the  article  because  generally  no  one  enters  the  same  text  or  use \nsame words that are present in an article into the text box instead they often use different \nwords and write only summary of what they read or heard somewhere so abstractive text \nsummarization will do the same while extracting summary i.e. it may give different words \nand extract only important points of whole article so while searching if we search through \nsummary it may increase chances of matching users text. \nwe  also  introduced  OCR  ,  language translation  and  video from  text flexibilities  into the \nsystem. \n \n \nPS-I experience: I have learned about what are free and opensource projects, how to \nuse them and how to contribute them etc. I got experience of using agile methodology in \nsoftware development life cycle as we followed sdlc with daily sprints. so we got exposure \nto sdlc. i got experience of how to organize the work of different people in a team using \nplatforms  like  gitlab.

For example, I was allotted the Web \nDevelopment station of Swecha, but I chose an ML project. We had to make work on an \nML  model  that  can  detect  road  potholes  with  good  accuracy.  We  tested  several  pre-\ntrained  models  and finally  wrote  our own  CNN  model. Our project was  part  of  a  larger \ncitizen welfare project. We also did some work on developing API for this model so that \nother applications can use it easily. We were required to do a project demo for the client \nat the end of the PS. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The first contact with the company and the allotment of projects took \nsome time. The first month was mostly for seminars and teaching sessions related to the \nFree  Software  movement  and  ethical  software,  and  some  technologies,  like  Agile \ndevelopment, Orange ML, Computer Vision and so on. The work actually started towards \nthe  end  of  June.  The  project  mentors  and  coordinator  guided  us  well.  In  late  July,  the \nprocess  of  keeping  the  coordinator  and  mentor  updated  with  our  work  progress  was \nfollowed strictly, and we were given daily grades based on our work. As team lead, I also \nhad to give updates in team-lead meetings. \n \n \n\n383 \n \nLearning Outcome: I learned to work independently, and gained interpersonal skills from \nhaving to coordinate with teams that were working on other areas of our larger project. \n \n \n------------"

We started with making the the home page \nof  the  website  and  made  it  responsive  and  dynamic.  We  added  many  products  and \nenhanced the UI/UX of it. We created shopping page which lists each product along with \ndescription  and  incorporated filtering  and  sorting  features.  We  used  HTML,CSS  and \nJavascript  for  it.  The  complete  backend  was  done  using  NodeJS.  We  enhanced  user \ninterface and made the webpages look attractive and engaging. A specific product page \nwas  also  made  to  incorporate  live  time  bidding  using  hyperledger  fabric  blockchain \ntechnology. This helps both customers and farmers to interact in live time and shows the \ncurrent  bids  and  the  current  prices  of  each  and  every  product. We  also  made  a  cloud \ndatabase with sample data fitting the structure of the registration, bidding and shopping \npage and many more. We used MongoDB as our database for storing all the necessary \ninformation . We also did authentication using passport local mongoose and created the \nlogin/signup  pages.  The  project  was  concluded  by  connecting  backend  and  the \nblockchain part with the frontend and finally deploying it. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  great  to  be  a  part  of  Swecha  and  contribute  to  free  software \ndevelopment.

The pace of the project was a little \nslow  to  start  with,  but  it  picked  up  in  time.  The  mentors  and  instructor  were  very \ncooperative and understanding, and working with my peers from other campuses was a \ngood experience. The frequent chopping and changing of the project and demands from \nthe company was slightly difficult to deal with, but we were well guided throughout. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: The company placed a lot of emphasis on the usage of free software \ntools, so I learned about many new tools that I didn't know of before. They also conducted \nvarious  sessions  and  panel discussions  in  preparation  for  the  project  which  covered  a \nvariety of topics. On a personal level I learnt introductory web development in preparation \nfor  the  project  and  exchanged  knowledge  with  my  peers  too.  Lastly  I  also  gained  soft \nskills thanks to the nature of the project which emphasised on teamwork, meetings with \nclients and mentors as well as the group discussions conducted by the faculty in charge. \n \n \n------------"

I was asked to contribute to the development of an online \nblood  and  plasma  bank  portal.  .  This  was  my  first  introduction  to  the  world  of  web \ndevelopment. With my mentor’s permission,  I spent some days to learn HTML, CSS, and \nJavaScript.  I  mostly  contributed  to  the  development  of  the  UI  using  HTML,  CSS  and \nhelped in fixing some miscellaneous bugs and issues. This was my first time working with \na team, and it was good. \nDuring  the  second  half,  since  the  blood  bank  project  was  done,  I  was  allotted  a  new \nproject called “Auto Equivalence Evaluation”. I had to help in development of a UI for a \npython CLI program that could automatically evaluate coding questions. My team and I \nstarted with making the wireframes of the different webpages that were needed. Then, \nthe team was divided into 2 subgroups, front end and back end. I was in front end and \nmy task was to develop a page where teachers could upload questions along with sample \ninput  and  output.  I  made  the  UI  from  scratch  using  HTML,  CSS  and  Bootstrap.    The \nwebpage  is  responsive  and  has  cool  UI  effects  like  navbar  hover  effects.  I  also \ncommunicated with the backend team so that the data entered in the webpage can be \nstored in a database. I also maintained the project’s Gitlab repo.  \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS1 has been a great learning experience for me. I got to know how \nthe industry works.

The title of the project is \"Pothole Detection\". The backbone \nof the project is the Machine Learning model which  we use to  classify potholes in the \npictures available to us in the dataset. Well developed  libraries in python like tensorflow,  \nsklearn  and  keras  are  being  used  to  construct    the model. After  a pothole  is  detected, \nmatplotlib  is  used  to  construct  a  box    around  it  to  highlight  the  region.  The  model  can \nhandle multiple pothole detections  in the same image. User interaction is solely through \nthe planned web application which will both act  as the node for new images to add to the \ndataset as well as the site for our final  map populated with all pothole locations. The \nunderlying  structure  is  developed    with  HTML  +  CSS  as  is  standard.    JavaScript  and \nNodeJS  are  used  for  server    management.  Finally,    mongoDB  is  used  for  database \nmanagement.  The  Machine  Learning  model  used  was  a  CNN  (Convolutional  Neural \nNetwork), trained using Keras. The model takes an input image into the convolution layer. \nEach image is then passed through a series of convolution layers with filters (Kernels) to \nclassify  the  object  with  probabilistic  values,  ranging  from  0  to  1. In  this  we  actually \nimproved the accuracy of the prediction. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Its  really  a  excellent  experience  to  work  for  PS-1.

We came across certain truths behind the giant tech \ngroups  like  Google,  Microsoft.  We  were  taught  the  importance  of  open-source,  non-\nproprietary  free  software  and  were  strongly  encouraged  to  use  free  and  open-source \nalternative software to almost everything on our electronic devices, from basic messaging \napplications to the operating system software. \nAfter almost 1 month, we were allotted our projects and our roles. I was assigned the Live \nstreaming and conferencing project. I was made the team leader, courtesy of my 10 team \nmembers.  During  the  initial  days,  after  getting  the  project,  the  objectives  were  a  little \nvague. They seemed a little off topic from our project title. Our first task as a team was \nbuilding a Gutenberg page about our project. But 2-3 weeks after the project allotment, \nthe project mentor contacted me, and asked me to gather all the team members to discuss \nthe further plan of action. In the first meet with our industry mentor and client, we were \nfamiliarized by the software architecture of the project and were given a task to create \nindividual  Django  projects.  Upon  completing  that,  we  were  told  that  the  whole  website \nbase  had  to  be  changed  from  Django  to  Drupal,  a  content  management  system.  In \nbetween all this, we had to follow the Agile SDLC method and the version control system \nthrough the git software.  At the end, we were able to accomplish the major part of our \nproject as a team, and hence, I consider this internship a fulfilling one. \n \n \nPS-I experience: My PS-1 experience was a quite fruitful one. I got to learn many things. \nThe industry mentors and the institute faculty were quite responsive and sweet to talk to. \nThis experience also inculcated a sense of responsibility within me. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I  learnt  about  the  free  software  movement  and  understood  about \nopen-source, non-proprietary, free software. My Django knowledge base got stronger. I \nlearnt about a user-friendly tool to make websites called Drupal, a content management \n\n410 \n \nsystem. I learnt quite a lot of git commands and got an idea about how things work in the \nsoftware industry. \nI learnt what it takes to be a good team leader and bring spirit and energy to the team. \n \n \n------------"

Most  of  the  time  it  was  dedicated \ntowards  learning  the  code  base  and  trying  to  analyse  and  optimise  the  same.  I  was \nresponsible for designing and running some pattern recognition queries on the database \non the live stream of data. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Overall the experience was good enough. I got to learn a lot about the \nway the industry really functions. For an industry like Swiggy which works on such highly \nsecured data and for which the security of its customers is integral, it was understandable \nthat the data was only selectively shared. Even though the 6 weeks of industry exposure \ndidn't require us much to implement per se, but learning wise it was satisfactory. I would \nlike  to  appreciate  the  fact  that  Swiggy  uses  a  number  of  open  source  softwares  that \nenabled me to learn concepts which can be applied to any field or industry I work for in \nthe later stages. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Hard  Skills:  I  got  to  learn  GoLang  which  is  heavily  used  in  the \nindustry  today.  Apart  from  this,  I  was  exposed  to  KAFKA,  REDIS  and  FLINK  among \nvarious other data processing and live streaming softwares. It also enabled me to revise \non my concepts of XML and SQL. An experience in working in JAVA was beneficial for \nthe same. \n\n435 \n \nSoft Skills: Though an online modality reduces the one-on-one interaction with people, \nhowever at the same time it enabled to push my own boundaries and reach out to the \nmentor on Slack / Meet. \n \n \n------------"

The  project  allotted  to  us  lied  in  the  field  of  Data  Science.  Our  mentor  for  this \nproject was Mr. Biswajit Mahapatra. We worked under their Guidance on a project “Movie \nRecommendation System: Netflix”. The dataset for our recommendation system was in \nthe form of .csv files stored in multiple files namely- IMDb Movies.csv, IMDb ratings.csv, \nNetflix_titles.csv,  Books.csv.  We  had  to  merge  these  files  &  we  completed  project  on \nPython Notebooks. 3 Important concepts that were involved in building the recommender \nsystem are: Vectors, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity. So with the help of these concepts, we \nbuilt a content based recommendation system for Netflix which recommends movies to \nuser  based  on  the  multiple  descriptions  like  Title,  Cast,  Director,  Plot,    Listed  in  which \nmight be helpful for UST to attract new customers in this OTT field like Netflix etc. with \nthe help of our project. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  with  the  company  was  overall  nice.

Potential buyers can \neither participate in the simultaneous multiple-round auction system(as proposed by Paul \nMilgrom and Robert Wilson) or simply purchase the art NFT from the marketplace. The \nobjective of having a multi-round auction system instead of a normal English auction is to \npreserve  both  buyer  and  seller interests.  Other  auction  types  generally  suffer  from  the \nproblem of \"Winner's Curse\" wherein they are unable to properly value the item and end \nup  overpaying.  This  in  the long  run  reduces the  interest  among  the  buyers  and  thus, \nharms  the  artists  who  see lesser  participation  in  the  future  auctions.  Ensuring  that  the \nbids  are  blind  during  the bidding  process  is  a  key  aspect  of  the  auction  process.  The \nproject  thus  involves writing  the  necessary  smart  contracts  and  developing  the  web \napplication enabling the minting, listing and auctioning of the NFTs. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  industry  mentor  we  had  was  very  supportive  and  guided  me \nthroughout the project.

None \nof us were familiar with the nuances of Blockchain and Blockchain development so the \nfirst part of PS-1 involved researching and understanding the theory of how Blockchain \n\n463 \n \nworks, with a primary focus on the Ethereum Blockchain. I explored several resources, \nincluding reading the Ethereum Whitepaper written by Vitalik Buterin.  \nAfter familiarising myself with how Blockchain works, I started learning Solidity, which is \nthe  main  language  used  for  writing  Smart  Contracts  in  Blockchain  development.  I  was \nresponsible for developing the auction smart contract and so, I needed to be proficient \nwith key concepts and data structures in Solidity. I learnt how to deploy Smart Contracts \non Remix IDE and also test them using the Truffle framework and the Ganache Personal \nBlockchain. I spent a lot of time reading the documentation of Solidity and Truffle to learn \nhow to write the relevant code for our application.  \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: PS - 1  was  an  insightful  experience  overall.  I  acquired  several  skills \nover the course of the project, both in terms of technical skills as well as soft skills. When \nit  comes  to  soft  skills,  my  teamwork  and  communication  skills  were  enhanced  in  the \nprocess of collaborating with the three other members of my team. We learnt about each \nother’s coding styles and distributed the parts of the project accordingly.  \nAs far as technical skills go, this was my first time working on developing a project and I \nwas  introduced  to  the  various  stages  of  project  development.  I  learnt  more  about \nprogramming languages and their real-world applications.  \nThe UST team was very supportive, with daily meetings every morning. Our mentor would \ntake the time out to help us whenever we were stuck for a long time. They did their best \nto ensure that we do not lose out in any way due to the remote nature of PS - 1 this year. \n \n \n \nLearning Outcome: As mentioned before, I developed several skills throughout PS - 1. \nWorking  on  Blockchain  development  introduced  me  to  several  new  concepts - the \nworkings  of  Blockchain,  programming  in  Solidity,  the  workings  of  Smart  Contracts  and \nhow to test them using the Truffle framework. There are several other technical skills I \nhave acquired over the course of the project, which have built my confidence to work on \nbuilding Blockchain projects in the future as well.

The entire \nsystem is placed on Ethereum blockchain. We develop a web application where sellers \ncan put their art tokes for auction and specify a minimum price for their item. My main \nwork was centred around making the smart contract and the front end interactive part for \nthe auction system. Our aim was also to provide a secured and private system where the \nbids will be hidden, and, thus, cannot be used to the disadvantage of any bidder. We first \ngathered  the  required  knowledge  of  blockchain  and  its  development  through  small \nprojects before working on the final project. We will be continuing to work on this project \neven after the internship to develop updates in it. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  got  to  learn  loads  about  working  in  a  team  environment,  and \ncommunicating everyday with our teammates and mentors.

Overall, \nalthough remote, the PS-1 experience was an amazing one with more things to learn than \nI initially presumed. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Blockchain basics and intermediary knowledge – We learnt about \nhow  blockchain  functions  under  the  hood,  the  architecture  of  Ethereum blockchain \nnetwork, mining, and all the fields where blockchain can be used to improve security and \nsafety of users. \nSolidity – We  got  an  in-depth  understanding  of  Solidity  by  first  making  a  simple  smart \ncontract, and then the SMRA contract system. Smart contracts are great for ensuring that \ntransactions can occur without failure. We also write the NFT smart contract in solidity. \nTruffle  and  Ganache -  We  learnt  how  to  test  smart  contracts  and  conduct  local \ntransactions smoothly in our system using Truffle Suite and Ganache local server. \nReact.JS – The client side of the application was built on React.JS, so we learnt how to \nbuild the front end. \nTeam-work and coordination – Due to the remote nature of the internship we learnt how \nto efficiently communicate with our team members while we work on similar or different \nparts of the project. \n \n \n------------ \n\n465"

Precisely  speaking,  the  problem  statement  was:  \"To \ngenerate documentation for VComply APIs from AWS API Gateway, which is compliant \nwith Open API Specification and implement and automate Swagger UI for the generated \ndocumentation.\" Open API Specification is a standard for documenting APIs such that it \nis  both  human  as  well  as  machine  readable.  The  first  task  was  to  find  ways  to  extract \nOAS document from the AWS API Gateway (both manually, and from within a script). The \nnext task in the project involved generating a Swagger UI for the given documentation. \nSwagger UI is an engine which reads in OAS document and produces a static, interactive \ndocumentation for the APIs. The task was to accomplish building of Swagger UI for our \nAPIs  first  manually,  then  automate  the  process  as  manual  update  method  would  be \ncumbersome.  The  few  hurdles  faced  in  the  project  were:  1.  OAS  document  was  not \navailable as an open URL. We needed to access it from within an application specially \nbuilt for that. 2. Automating the building of Swagger UI meant we could not work with the \nengine and had to again use other frameworks/libraries to do that. 3. Automating for a \nsingle  API  worked  fine,  but  to  integrate  multiple  APIs  the method  was  undocumented. \nThe two months in PS 1 were this utilized in understanding deeper concepts and resolving \nthese hurdles. \n \n \nPS-I experience: My PS 1 experience was at par with my expectations.

Once the \nAPI gateway is up and running, all we did was to generate the OpenAPI document from \nthis API gateway. The OpenAPI document is then exported, parsed into a spec file and \nfed into the Swagger engine. This would generate the Swagger UI documentation for our \nAPI gateway. The Swagger UI documentation would be hosted on S3 as a static website \nand every time one redeploys the stack, the website is built and redeployed on S3, which \ngives us an ever-updated Swagger UI documentation for our APIs. \nThe  technologies  and  services  incorporated  in  our  project  were  Node.js,  Serverless \nframework,  AWS(Cognito  for  user  authentication,  CloudFront  for  hosting,  S3,  API \nGateway) and NPM. \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS-1 experience was an enriching one. I spent most of my time learning \nnew technologies, frameworks and languages. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: 1. Implemented  a  test(dummy)  API  on  AWS,  fetched  the  API \nspecification from the API Gateway to leverage an interactive web UI. \n2. Gained understanding about AWS (Amazon Cognito, CloudFront, API Gateway, S3, \netc) and AWS SDK. \n3.  Got  acquainted  with  serverless framework  which  automates  the  entire  process  of \nuploading APIs on AWS and an interactive Swagger website, on the output. \n4. Learned Node.js runtime environment, NPM and the application of both in our project. \n\n473 \n \n5.  Learned  Swagger  and  tried  documenting  some  dummy  APIs  through  SwaggerHub \n(non-automated). \n6.  Integrated  Amazon  Cognito  with  the  interactive  website  for  adding  a  layer  of \nauthentication. \n7. Incorporated Amazon CloudFront Distribution for website hosting. \n8.  The  front-end  of  the  website  was  majorly  managed  through  webpack,  which  auto-\ngenerated the necessary files and rendered the website. \nApart  from  this,  I  also  imbibed  some  soft  skills,  how  an  organization  works  and  co-\nordination among the team members. \n \n \n------------"

The overarching objective is to open new \nsources of data for analysis, visualization & actionable insights. \nGeolocation Based Redirection-  The process of automatically redirecting a website visitor \nby their geolocation (country, state or city). It works by detecting the visitor's location from \ntheir IP address by matching it against a database of IPs and locations. Two major calls \nfor  action  on  the  website - sign  up  to  be  a  Mentor  &sign  up  for  expedition  trips.  The \norganization  needs  more  Mentors  from  outside  US,  either  to  fill  mentorship  slots  not \nconvenient in US time zone and/or to find bilingual mentors (Spanish). On the other hand, \nexpedition trips are mainly targeting people residing in US. \nWeb  Server  Logs- Need  for  accessing  server  logs  for  our  custom  data  dashboards. \nTesting  by  installing  [metabase.com](http://metabase.com)  on  an  Ubuntu  server  with \nApache or nginx (credentials shared over slack). Connecting the same tool to Oracle DB \nand the organization's nginx server. \n \n \n\n489 \n \n \nPS-I experience: In the orientation, all of us, the students, the university mentors and the \ncompany mentors, introduced ourselves. As part of the onboarding, we were explained \nin length as to how Village Book Builders operated, the company’s vision and the part \nthat the interns would play in it. Since the company uses React, Redux for the frontend \nand Django for the backend, in the following days, we were given extensive resources \nand  were  required  to  learn  both.    Learning  how  geolocation  tracking  works  between \nBrowsers & Web Servers, Finding out what all can be logged/tracked by nginx & Apache \nweb servers, Going through Java Script code of Google Analytics and finding how it is \nbeing  blocked  by  Firefox,  Brave  etc.  and  also  researching  into  Google's  Federated \nLearning of Cohorts (FLoC) as a replacement for cookie-based tracking and looking into \nhow & why is WordPress blocking this move are some of the examples of learning tasks \nthat were given. One of the tasks required us to redirect users to different web pages (on \nthe same website) based upon their location. We were asked to provide separate scripts \nfor  both  the  backend  and  frontend  part  for  the  geolocation  problem  statement.  In \naccordance with the LAMP architecture I provided scripts for the backend using Apache \nand  PHP.  For  the  frontend  part  I  primarily  used  JavaScript,  the  geo-plugin  tools  and \ngeolocation API to achieve the same result. We need to access server logs for our custom \ndata dashboards. We were required to test by installing \n[metabase.com](http://metabase.com)  on  an  Ubuntu  server  with  Apache  or  nginx.  To \nhave  an  oracle  database  accessible  in  the  NGINX  server  we  were  provided  an  oracle \nwallet with login credentials to access the same. To connect to the Autonomous Database \nthrough an HTTPS proxy, I had to update the tnsnames.ora file in the wallet zip file. After \nadding  the  HTTP  proxy  hostname(https_proxy)  and  port  (https_proxy_port)  to  the \nconnection string, I replaced the values with my HTTPS proxy information. The concepts \nI had to look up were JDBC Thin Connections and Wallets, SSL Connection to Oracle DB \nusing JDBC, TLSv1.2, JKS or Oracle Wallets, Oracle Secure Sockets Layer and Amazon \nRelational Database Service. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: Gaining working knowledge of web analytics, dynamic targeting of \ncontent,  descriptive  statistics  &  data  visualization. Dynamically  nudging  users  towards \ndifferent   conversion   funnels   based   upon   predefined   user   characteristics. Cross \nreferencing data from siloed applications & logs to build custom dashboards. \n \n \n \n------------"

We were also allotted the task at the later stage of PS to build an all-in-one load \nbalancer,  web  server,  content  cache,  and  API  gateway  to  complete  the  model  for  the \nwebsite. \n \n \nPS-I experience: I had a very good experience working at my PS station. I was part of \nthe  Full  Stack  1  team  at  the  station,  but  our  work  mainly  involved  BACKEND  for  the \nwebsite.  I  was  happy  to  work  for  the  backend  of  the  website  as  I  already  knew \nFRONTEND.  My PS-I  experience  can  be  divided  into  three  parts – the  first  one  being \nlearning   new   languages   and   tutorials.   I   learned   Node.js,   Express.js,   MongoDB, \nMongoose,  which  helped  me  to  become  a  MERN  stack  developer.  The  second  being \nbuilding  different  microservices  for  the  VoiceQube  website - Authorization  service, \nCatalog  service,  Catalog  Update  service,  User  service,  Payment  service  &  customer \nsupport  services.  The  third  part  being  making  an  all-in-one  load  balancer,  web  server, \ncontent cache, and API gateway to complete the model for the website. Finally, I would \nadvise juniors that if you want to work hard in the summer breaks to polish your skills in \nweb development, go for the Web developer role in the VoiceQube. You will learn a lot in \nthe  field,  provided  you  work  hard.  Work  culture  could  be  somewhat  hectic  for  web \ndeveloper role but there are some roles in sq teams which involves making stories for the \nwebsite. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learned a lot of stuff here.  I first studied languages like Node.js, \nExpress.js,  MongoDB,  Mongoose  and  completed  the  languages  to  become  a  MERN \nstack  developer.  I  learned  NIGNX,  developing  AWS  instance  EC  2,  stripe  &  Git \ncommands. I also got to know using postman for testing the APIs and preparing the API \ndocumentation  for the  different  microservices.  Apart  from  the  core  project,  I  learned \nthings, from how an organization functions to how teams coordinate on projects. The PS \nalso improved my communications skills, attention to detail and soft skills. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n499"

Our PS1 work at BISAG-N Gandinagar, was \nto develop a Web application to perform AI based Change Detection and Clustering on \nmulti-spectral Sentinel data. It is mainly divided into two parts, namely GIS Analysis using \nQGIS Python API, and Django Web Development (GeoDjango). Change Detection is a \nmethod of understanding how a given geographic area has changed between two or more \ndifferent time periods. It involves comparing changes between geographic data (Raster \nData).  As  per  our  BISAG-N  Mentor  guidance,  first  we  familiarized  ourselves  with  GIS \nconcepts  and GIS-analysis  softwares  like  QGIS,  and  SAGA.  Then,  we  used  modules \noffered by QGIS Python API and SAGA API to do the analysis. Further, we explored AI \nbased  change  detection  techniques,  and  performed  a  comparision  study  between \ntraditional and AI based techniques. We developed a web application using GeoDjango \nFramework, along with postgresSQL as our database. We used Openlayers package to \nrender maps on the web browser. Geoserver was used to publish and share geospatial \n\n26 \n \ndata (Raster Data). Further, Geoserver's support for OGC's Web Map Services (WMS) \nwas  used  to  send  HTTP  requests,  for  requesting  georeferenced  map  images  from  the \nserver to the client (fronetend). We also included extra features like User login, triggering \nemails to users when change is detected, In-app notifications and Search functionality. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Though PS1 is in virtual  mode, I had a good experience working with \nmy PS1 station BISAG-N. I got the opportunity to experience the working methodology of \na government research organisation.

Initially  I  used  8086  based \nmicroprocessor  system  to  display  the  humidity  value  on  an  LCD  module  as  that  was \ntaught at BITS. But later on, due to issues like complexity in writing assembly code for \nhandling  decimal  arithmetic,  8086  is  outdated  and  hardly  anyone  uses  it  in  practical \napplications  and  also  the  fact  that  Proteus  7  (software  on  which  initial  simulation  was \ndone)  did  not  have  any  module  for  TFT  screens,  I  had  to  learn  and  use  Arduino \nprogramming to make the new circuit. The new simulation was done in Proteus 8 which \nhad  the TFT module and  Arduino  had  in-built  libraries for  handling TFT  screens  which \nmade the task a lot simpler and commercially viable.  Also added an extra feature to view \nand  edit  date  and  time  on  the  TFT  screen  so  that  variations  of  humidity  can  be  seen \nduring different parts of the day. \n \n \nPS-I experience: The experience was great.

Initially  I  used  8086  based \nmicroprocessor  system  to  display  the  humidity  value  on  an  LCD  module  as  that  was \ntaught at BITS. But later on, due to issues like complexity in writing assembly code for \nhandling  decimal  arithmetic,  8086  is  outdated  and  hardly  anyone  uses  it  in  practical \napplications  and  also  the  fact  that  Proteus  7  (software  on  which  initial  simulation  was \ndone)  did  not  have  any  module  for  TFT  screens,  I  had  to  learn  and  use  Arduino \nprogramming to make the new circuit.

So,  they  can  be  used  in  security  body  scanners  for  effective  security \nimaging of threat objects like scissors, blades, and so on (e.g., airports). However, due to \nthe lack of Terahertz technology for generation and detection (THz gap), very few images \nare  available  to  build  automated  security  systems  based  on  unsupervised  machine \nlearning algorithms that can detect threat objects on their own. Generating fake images \nthat somewhat resemble these threat objects might be able to solve this problem.  \nMy  task  was  to  produce  these  fake  images  using  a  deep-learning-based  generative \nmodel,  known  as  Generative  Adversarial  Network  (GAN).  I  was  provided  with  some \nterahertz images of a pair of scissors by my mentor. A GAN is a model that is made up \nof two competing neural networks known as the generator and the discriminator. I had \ndeveloped  CNNs  for  each  of  these.  The  loss  function  used  was  Binary  Cross-Entropy \nloss and for Optimization, I had used the Adam Optimizer. At the end of my PS, I was \nable to provide satisfactory images of scissors. \n \n\n89 \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-1  experience  was  really  enriching,  I  learned  a  lot  in  these  2 \nmonths.

While  there  are  several  accurate  ways  of  analysing  FSSs, the \nEquivalent Circuit Modelling method is often used for the analysis of the structures as it \ninvolves fewer calculations, especially for simple periodic shapes. This method involves \nreplicating the FSS model into an equivalent RLC circuit, whose lumped RLC parameters \ncan be derived from various methods like the Vector Fitting Method for instance. In this \nproject,  the  aim  is  to  ultimately  derive  the  equivalent  circuit  model  of  the  given  FSS \nstructure and further simulate the circuit  along with the structure using Advanced design \nSystem  (ADS)  and  CST  Microwave  Studio  to  match  and  verify  the  correctness  of  the \nequivalent  circuit.  Following  the  literature  review,  two  different  structures  and  their \nequivalent circuit models were simulated. A full wave simulation of the meta surface was \ndone using CST Microwave Studio software and the equivalent circuit was simulated in \nADS. After running the simulations, the graphs of S-Parameter vs Frequency were cross-\nverified. For the first structure[11], the CST and ADS graphs were found to be the same \nwhereas for the second structure[12], the graphs were found to be similar but with minor \ndeviations. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: Great  experience.

Microstrip antenna being lighter in weight, low cost, low profile, smaller \nin  dimension  and  having  ease  of  fabrication  and  conformity  was  chosen  as  the  basic \nantenna for design. Towards preliminary design the essential concepts of antenna theory \nand  microstrip  antennas  were  studied.  This  was  followed  by  a  detailed  study  on \nmetamaterials  and  their  usage  in  antenna  design.  In  the  later  half  of  the  project,  a \nmicrostrip  antenna  was  designed  and  simulated  using  feeding  methods  such  as \nmicrostrip line feed and coaxial feed. A metamaterial with double circular ring structure \nwas then inserted into the antenna as substrate/superstrate and their effect on properties \nsuch as S-parameters, VSWR, gain and efficiency were observed and compared to that \nwithout the metamaterial. The design and simulation of the antenna was done using CST \nStudio Software. \n \n \nPS-I experience: PS-1 was extremely fruitful. With help of constant support from both the \nfaculty and industry mentors, we were able to explore a new learning curve. This helped \nus  dive  deep  into  the  field  of  antenna  design  and  observe  various  minute  details  that \nimprove their performance. The project was very well paced and helped us to make the \nmost out of these 2 months. \n \n \n\n92 \n \nLearning  outcome: The  requirements  for  an  aerospace  application  antenna  includes \nlightweight, small size, high gain and bandwidth. From the literature survey, the microstrip \npatch antenna was found to be the most popular choice for a miniaturized antenna, by \nfar. However, many papers have highlighted the drawbacks of the conventional microstrip \nantenna,  such  as  low  gain  and  directivity,  low  radiation  power,  smaller  size,  etc.  To \nenhance some of these properties as well as introduce other useful parameters, many \nnovel methods have been researched. One such method is the use of metamaterials in \norder  to  enhance  properties  such  as  gain,  directivity,  bandwidth,etc.  Based  on  all  the \npapers read thus far and the application to use is for aerospace communication, it has \nbeen  decided  to  design  a  microstrip  patch  antenna  that  operates  in  the  Ku  band  of \ncommunication. \n \n \n------------"

The  lower  portion  of  a  fuel  pin  consists  of  a  plenum  space  to \naccommodate the fission gases below the fuel column placed in the upper portion. The \ncrimping on the clad, which is the outer casing of the fuel rod, restricts the middle plug to \nslide  through  and  ensures  that  the  fuel  column  remains  supported.  However,  the \nassembly could fail when the middle plug slips through the clad or when the clad ruptures \ndue to high stresses. Hence, there is a necessity to estimate the maximum load which \nthe assembly can handle safely to ensure that such failures do not occur during operation. \nThe  CAD  of  the  clad-middle  plug  interface  is  created  in  Autodesk  Fusion  360.

I was given  the design of the periscope, where key elements were – Optical \ntube, Xenon arc lamps, end supports and flexible hoses.

The flexible hoses, the end \nsupports for the hoses and the coolant (argon gas) form this cooling system. Earlier, metal \n(corrugated) hoses are under use, and now, the use of silicon flexible hoses is proposed. \nWhen the coolant passes through the flexible hose at high speed (~35 m/s) (because of \nthe space constraints, area of pipe has limitation), there occur flow induced vibrations in \nthe flexible hose.

The Image was converted in to a grayscale image \nand  then  binarized  for  easy  detection  of  defects.  After  this  edge  detection  and  blob \nanalysis  were  performed  to  clearly  see  pits, cracks,  bumps  or other  deformities on the \nsurface of the rod. Thus, an efficient and accurate system for the detection of defects on \nthe surface of a metal rod was created using the project. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS  experience  was quite  fruitful. We  had  amazing  mentors  who \nguided us through every step of the process. And despite PS-1 taking place in an online \nsemester, we had little difficulty adapting and ensured that our project did not suffer as a \nresult. While it would have been an amazing experience to work on the project offline, I \nstill believe that we had an amazing session overall. \n \n \nLearning outcome: We learnt -  \n1) Camera Design and Specifications \n2) Affects of Lighting on image quality \n3) Using a stepper motor \n4) MATLAB for Image Processing \n5) Soft Skills such as communicating using just online means \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n141"

With the COVID-\n19 induced lockdown conditions, administrators of IGCAR computer systems were forced \nto  work  from  home.  Their  servers  used  the  traditional  access  method – Secure  Shell \n(SSH). Though it was able to provide security up to a level, the same could be greatly \nenhanced by introducing a second factor of authentication. In this project, we explored \nand implemented a secure second factor of authentication mechanism that could be used \nalong  with  the  standard  SSH  based  access  to  a  computer  server  running  CentOS  7 \noperating system. We chose to implement a time-based one-time password to act as the \nsecond layer. We had to configure both the server side code and the client side mobile \napplication in a way that was unique for IGCAR. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  had  an  amazing  experience  at  IGCAR.  After  the  initial  delay  in  the \nallotment of projects, the journey ahead was smooth. I was allotted a team project in the \ndomain of Computer Science. The problem statement was easy to understand but I had \nno  idea  in  which  direction  to  proceed.  My  mentor  from  IGCAR  was  very  helpful  and \nprovided  me  with  the  necessary  tools  to  get  started  with  the  project. We  had  frequent \nvideo calls and exchanged emails whenever I was stuck on a problem, he was always \nthere to help me out. The project was open ended in the sense that I had the flexibility to \n\n144 \n \nchoose  what  frameworks  and  open  source  tools  I  wanted  to  use.  One  thing  that  felt \ntedious at that time, but in retrospect, was very helpful was writing out reports. I realized \nthe importance of documenting every step of the project. It helps in bringing clarity about \nthe current state of the project and also helps in planning the path ahead in a structured \nmanner.  The  problem  statement  that  I  worked  on will  have  real  impact  on  the  IGCAR \nservers, and I feel that I was able to contribute meaningfully to it. I would have loved to \nhave an offline PS1 at IGCAR, but I feel that the experience I had was good enough in \nthe online mode. \n \n \nLearning   outcome: The   broad   learning   outcome   was   to   figure   out   how   user \nauthentication works. I learnt about Secure Shell (SSH) and various encryption schemes \nused for storing passwords and secure communication over an unsecure network. I also \nunderstood the underlying mechanisms for time-based one-time passwords and HMAC-\nbased one-time passwords. I discovered techniques for hardening a server and adding \nmultiple layers of security. Since, we had to prepare a client-side mobile application for \ngenerating  TOTPs,  I  learnt  the  basics of  Flutter  and  was  able  to  build  a  demo  mobile \napplication to be used by IGCAR scientists. Apart from that, writing frequent reports and \ndocumenting every step of the journey was an integral part of PS1 at IGCAR, which is a \nuseful skill to acquire. \n \n \n------------"

We implemented Monte-Carlo simulator for the end-to-end \nsystem on MATLAB, implemented polar coding for the channel coding and used FFMPEG \nto  compress  the  video  using  AVC  and  HEVC  codecs.  We  graphed  the  performance \nmetrics of the system and switched to using LDPC instead of polar codes. Overall, we \nimplemented  systems  for  evaluating  performance  by  varying parameters,  transferring \nfiles and live streaming webcam data. Additionally, we improved the simulator to employ \nparallel processing wherever possible and wrote scripts to detect and reason out the burst \nerrors   faced. As   part   of learning   process,   we   took   courses   online   on   wireless \ncommunications,  LDPC, polar  coding,  software-defined  radios, digital  image and  video \nprocessing.   I   got   to implement   it   all   on   MATLAB   at varying   scale   using   the \ncommunications toolbox, Simulink and the image processing toolbox as a part of either \nthe project or the learning process. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It was very educational and gave deep insight into different fronts of the \nworld of communications, various problems faced and how they are being tackled.

It is an automation control system that is used in industries such as energy, \n\n183 \n \noil, gas,  water,  power and many  more.  The advent and  development  of  the  smart  grid \nconcept  to  operate  the  electric power  grids  and microgrids  have  introduced number  of \nopportunities  for  improving  efficiencies  and overall  performance.  A  supervisory  control \nand data acquisition (SCADA) system provides an appealing scheme for remote control \nand observation of renewable energy sources (RES). SCADA systems have been used \nwidely in various industrial applications and have helped improve the efficiency of such \nsystems.  SCADA systems,  however,  still  face  some  challenges  in  the  effort  to  ensure \nreliability, safety and security for power generation, transmission and distribution. One of \nthe consideration in designing the capabilities of smart grid is the integration of SCADA \nsystems to enable remote control of electric microgrids and grids, supervise and control \nthe electric network equipment as means of fulfilling reliability and desired efficiencies for \nthe  whole  utility.  Given  the  ability  of  these  systems  to control  the  flow  of  electricity \nthroughout  the  network,  additional  planning  is  required  to ensure  that  all  possible \nmeasures for preventing compromise are considered. This report discusses the current \noverall system architecture and some of the security measures used. More importantly, it \nconsiders  simplifying  the  implementation  of many  required  standards.  Because  of  the \nunpredictable characteristics of the RES, it has become important to constantly monitor \ntheir states in order to determine the amount of energy that is generated at all times. This \nwill help in planning power usage and save energy when the sources are not enough for \npower generation. It will be practically impossible, however, to station personnel who will \nmonitor  the  state  of the  sources  constantly,  hence  the  need  for  a remote  monitoring \nsystem.  This  project provides  an  overview  of  utilization  of  SCADA  systems  in  electric \npower  systems.  It presents  the  main  components  of  SCADA  platforms,  including  the \nmaster   station hardware   and   software.   The   outstation   hardware,   including   data \nacquisition devices such as remote terminal units and programmable logic controllers, will \nbe  presented. These  devices  are  integrated  with  intelligent  electronic  devices,  data \nconcentrators and  other  communication  equipment.  The  fundamentals  and  possible \napplication functions  of  SCADA  systems  unveil  the  potential  of smart  grid  and  inspire \nmore minds to get involved in the development process. SCADA systems can optimize \nand improve PV generation and can improve wind farm performance during operation. \n \n \nPS-I experience: Good learning experience.  \n \n \nLearning  outcome: I studieed  about  Pre  dispatch  and  post  dispatch  of  energy \nmanagement,   applications   and   also   about   power   system   for   SCADA   function, \nTransducers and Relays, Analog to Digital Converter, Optical Fibre Communications. \n \n \n------------"

It  has  the \nfollowing specifications, (1) A 4 digit seven segment display capable of taking input from \na 4x3 keypad and (2) Must be portable to carry around, with a rechargeable battery. This \ntask can be accomplished with the help of microcontrollers. Among the various options, \nwe found that logistically and 8051 based architecture was able to fulfill the given needs. \nSo with the help of Proteus in which we ran our simulations of various models, we were \nable to compile the code required by the microcontroller in an Keil C51 IDE environment. \nThis code was then compiled and embedded into the microcontroller in the form of HEX \nfile.  The  entire  model  required  5V  to  operate  and  produced  negligible  amount  of  Heat \neven under prolonged conditions. With the help and guidance of our mentors at Prama \nInstruments, the project neared completion in our 4th Week. We had additionally modified \nand  added sound  sensor  component  which  detects  sound  nearby  and  alerts  the  user \nabout the same on 16x2 LCD. Key bindings were also added in order to produce distinct \nset of vibrations and monotone sounds by buzzer every time an input was given, making \nthe model more versatile. For the later part of the PS1, we produced similar model but \nthis time with an Arduino controller to be more customizable and user friendly. With the \nadded capability of an Arduino, we also implemented an ultrasonic sensor, which has the \ncapability  of  detecting  the  exact  distance  to  a  nearby  object,  if  any,  by  the  action  of  a \nbuzzer.  This  greatly  boosted  the  value  of  the  product,  as  this  keeps  the  physically \nchallenged from harms way by alerting them before hand of an approaching vehicle, etc. \nWe also learnt lot about the economic aspects and production of these embedded and \nIoT devices in real life. Much emphasis was put in documenting whatever work we did, \nwhich greatly  enabled  us  to  work  in professional  environment  and  taught  us  the \nimportance of soft skills that are required in this line of work. \n \n \nPS-I experience: My Experience was fairly pleasant and informative.

It  has  several  machines  (resources)  used  for  this  purpose  such  as  milling \nmachine,  turning  machine,  etc.  Preparation  of  a  mould  consists  of  a  sequence  of \nactivities, each activity consuming a certain number of hours of a resource. We developed \na  software  to  create  a  macro  level  schedule  based  on  the moulds  to  be  prepared,  the \nactivities involved for each mould, resources needed for each activity and the priority of \nmoulds to be prepared. This schedule would help the management better understand the \ntimelines and enable them to commit realistic delivery dates to the customers.  \n \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: I  gained  invaluable  knowledge  working  at  Amritha  Tool  Crafts, \nHyderabad. I got a thorough insight into the scheduling of mould making processes and \nthe variety of machines available to carry out the production. I received extensive help \nfrom my PS-1 Faculty Professor Mukesh Kumar Rohil. He constantly gave reviews of our \nwork  and  offered  his  insights  to our  problems.  He  also  gave  us  access  to  multiple \nresources to study which helped us expand our understanding of the problem. Mr.Pardha \nSaradhi Pal, our mentor from the PS Station was always reachable to us and offered us \na lot of help in understanding the project requirements. He consistently set up meetings \nwith our team, reviewed our progress on the project and suggested changes to make. \nPursuing my PS-1 at Amritha Tool Crafts has helped me learn a lot of new things and \ngain a grip over the Python programming language. It was a fresh experience to be part \nof a company and know how work in the industry will feel like. A fun and knowledgeable \nexperience indeed! \n \n \n \nLearning Outcome: This project gives an overview of how planning software works, how \nscheduling may broadly be defined as the allocation of resources to tasks over time in \nsuch a way that a predefined performance measure is optimized. From the viewpoint of \nproduction scheduling, the resources and tasks are commonly referred to as machines \nand jobs and the commonly used performance measure is the completion times of jobs.  \nI  learnt  how  to  satisfy  various  constraints  like  the  number  of  working  hours  in  a  day, \naccommodating off-days and holidays, maintaining the relative order of the processes of \na part and many more. Moreover, this project has also exposed me to Jupyter notebooks \nand  its  wonderful  libraries  like  NumPy  and  Pandas  showing  how  easily  data  can  be \nhandled and manipulated. Pyomo library has given me great experience in solving linear \noptimization and constraint satisfaction problems. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n29"

Our team's focus was on welding automation. Initially we had to make \na  report  on  automated  welding  in  today's  world  and  then  we  were  given  the  task  of \ndesigning a welding positioner which is essentially a platform that can automatically move \nthe workpiece around to make it easier for a robotic arm to weld on it. Our focus was on \nmaking a product that offered a creative, commercial or operational advantage over the \ncompetitors. We  began  by making  sketches  for  the  design  on  paper  and  selecting  the \nappropriate  motors,  gearboxes,  materials  etc.  We  had  to  make  sure  our  work  was \nmechanically viable, I love zehaan sharma and feasible to fabricate. The next step was \n3D modelling in either SolidWorks or Fusion360 to make our designs more life-like. Since \n\n94 \n \nthe application was industry oriented, the force/torque demands were immense in some \ncases and a final stress analysis needed to be done to make sure we designed everything \nproperly and in the end we had to create a bill of materials to predict the cost of our design \nbeing implemented. Since our team showed enthusiasm throughout and completed this \nproject ahead of time, we were given another similar task regarding the automation of a \npunching press machine and we're continuing with this task outside of PS-1. \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  CEO  Pranam  Rajpurohit  and  CTO  Jubil  Mahadevan  were  our \nmentors throughout PS-1. After our team showed some pep in the first week by promptly \nfinishing tasks ahead of time, we were assigned this project. Jubil was not much older \nthan us and he was always very approachable and understanding to our concerns. There \nwas clear communication throughout and thus most of our work together was actually a \nlot of fun. The 3-D modelling period took up a lot of our time because it was something \nwe hadn't been taught in college and in general is a very tedious process. Also, designing \nsomething capable of adhering to industry standards, constraints of cost and availability \nwas something very challenging and warranted a lot of time. All in all, it was great learning \nexperience and it kept us hopeful about the jobs possible in the mechanical automation \nsector. We were also given an opportunity to work with the other teams if we wanted to \nexplore beyond our domain. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome: We  became  very  comfortable  with  3-D  modelling  (SolidWorks/ \nFusion360) which is a very essential process in designing. We also learned how to select \nthe best components while designing a product and how to optimize our designs while \nmaking  them  tolerant  to  bending,  torsion,  elongation  and  shearing  along  with  the  best \nmethods to fabricate them. We also learned a bit about what it takes to run a start-up in \nIndia through our mentors. \n \n \n------------"

The \ncompany  provided  constraints  like  diameter  and  maximum weight  of  workpiece.  Initial \nsketches were given before starting the CADing process. I used the Autodesk Fusion360 \nto model my design. As a team of 4, we submitted 4 separate designs. The later part of \nthe project was to select the appropriate working parts like motors and gearboxes which \n\n95 \n \nwould  meet  the  torque  requirement  of  the  designed  model  and  provide  the  adequate \nRPM.  This  required  the  use  of  the  moment  of  inertia  formula  among  other  theoretical \nformulas  and  concepts,  basically  what  we  learnt  in  the  previous  semesters.  Since  the \nassigned station was a startup, we had to consider providing cost effective alternatives to \nthe work parts. A bill of materials was also to be provided at the end of project. About 6 \nweeks in as this project was about to conclude, the company put forward a 2nd project \nas well - a gantry system to automate the press machine mechanism which basically is a \npick and place system. We were able to give in our inputs over the next week or so, but \nthe project was not concluded completely. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: Overall the PS-1 experience was fairly good. I had Domtech R&A as \nmy 3rd or 4th priority, since I wanted to try out more of the robotics/automation side of \nmechanical and they had that right in their name. I actually did not expect a design job \nbut I liked it to be honest. I had been trying to learn CAD over my 2nd year and this project \nprovided  a  major  boost  since  it  had  a  particular  goal,  deadlines  and  stuff.  The  initial  2 \nweeks  were  difficult  but  I  was  able  to  work  on  Fusion360  comfortably  after  the  initial \nhiccup.  \nThe company mentor was also helping and he tried to meet at least once a week in the \nfirst 3-4 weeks and kept deadlines forcing us to work and complete the tasks in time(in a \ngood way obviously). \nI  think  the  work  was  given  regularly  in  the  first  few  weeks  in  contrast  to  many  other \nstations, so that's a pro or con depending on what we expect out of PS1 - an easy A or \nwork experience. I wanted the experience and so did my teammates, so it panned out \nwell. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: The experience helped to get a grip on CAD, I am fairly comfortable \nwith  Fusion360 now,  I  got  to  try  out  simulations  as  well  on  Fusion.  This  was  also  an \nopportunity to put what we learnt in previous semesters to practical use. It also helped to \nimprove my communication skills since we worked as a team for the project. \n \n \n------------"

I \nwas allocated to the Fired Equipment Department, specifically in the steam generation \nsector.  I  understood  how  crucial  fired  equipment  like - Boiler,  Heat recovery  steam \ngenerator,  Sulphur  recovery  unit  and  many  other  auxiliary  equipments  work  and  their \napplication in various industries. Detailed Engineering drawings of these equipments, how \nto read them, conventions followed in the Industry were significant learnings. Some basic \nHeat transfer calculations were also done to support the theory. \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  experience  was  overall  satisfactory,  and  I  gained  vital  learnings \nboth  in  technical  and soft  skills.  Since  it  was  online,  more focus was  only  on theory  or \notherwise there is a lot to be learned about practical field too. Also, it is not precisely an \ninternship  but  more  of  a  program  where  you  need  to  apply  basic  knowledge  gained \nthrough courses and try to relate with real equipments in the Industry. \nMore important for me was the exposure I got by interacting with various personnel of the \norganization. \n \n \n\n97 \n \nLearning Outcome: The several meetings or learning sessions with the industry mentor \nwere very productive in terms of Industrial Knowledge.

ASME Section VIII Division 1 is a popular Boiler and Pressure \nVessel Code (BPVC) that is used in industries (especially hydrocarbon based) worldwide. \nAppendix-2 of this handbook enlists the rules for Bolted Flange Connections with Ring \nType Gaskets.  \nThese rules are nothing but formulas (or equations we may say) essential to the design \nof  flanges-a  vital  equipment  in  the  oil  &  gas  industry.  My  work  was to “derive” these \nformulas by considering the cross sections, design aspects involved. \nDesign  of  a  flange  included  determining  the  load  that  was  to  be  applied  by  bolting, \nconsidering the operating conditions and gasket seating conditions. Then, the moments \nworking  on  the  flange  due  to  various  axial  forces  was  calculated.  Minor  details  like \nempirical relations of bolt spacing, gasket & bolt dimensions and their selection etc. were \nalso  found.  Later,  various  stresses  acting  on  the  flange  were  elaborately  derived.  This \nwas  a  major  milestone  in  this  project.  Finally,  few  other  minor  details  like  allowable \nstresses, flanges under external pressure were considered. \nApart from this, I was given Vocational Training by EIL officers in the three sub divisions \nof  SMED-Package  Equipment,  Rotating  Equipment  &  Static  Equipment.  Training  was \ngiven through Google Meet lectures of 2-4 hours every day for a total of 6 weeks (2 weeks \neach for the three sub divisions). \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: My PS-1 journey at EIL was very fruitful-full of learning opportunities \nliterally  every  day.  My  company  mentor  was  a  senior  officer  at  EIL  with  decades  of \nindustry experience. His industry insights were invaluable for me. I communicated on a \nregular basis with my guide at EIL who gladly helped me whenever I was stuck at any \n\n98 \n \npoint  in  the  flanges  project.  I  had  to  refer  to  many  textbooks  on  the  topic  for  learning \npurpose. All the Vocational Training instructors (13 of them in total) were well qualified \nengineers  having  an  industry  experience  of  at  least  12-14  years.  Thus,  the  clarity  and \ndepth of their lectures was enriching for me. They were able career counsellors as well. \nOverall, PS1 at EIL was a memorable experience. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learnt in depth about the design of integral type bolted flanges and \ntheir applications. Vocational Training imparted industry relevant knowledge on an array \nof  topics  like  HVAC,  material  handling  equipment  like  cranes,  filtration  equipment, \ncompressors & pumps, steam & gas turbines, pressure vessels, heat exchangers (shell \n& tube type, air cooled) and storage tanks. \n \n \n------------"

For that, my mentor guided me in understanding the standards \nof lubricant testing, the types of tests performed in lubricants during these trials, and the \nimportance of limiting values in controlling the performance characteristics.  \nFinally, conclusions and recommendations to test my overall understanding were made, \nat the ending of the project. \n \n\n125 \n \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  was  okay.

The Iron ore pelletizing process consists \nmainly of three steps: raw material preparation; green pellet formation and the in-duration \nprocess;  these  three  steps  include  lots  of  controlling  parameters.  The  process  and \noperating parameters strongly influence the quality of the product pellets. Because of the \ndynamic  nature  of the  process  it  is  not  easy  to  control  and  maintain  the  desired  pellet \nquality. Therefore, modeling of such processes is very much needed to reduce the cost \nand  time  required  for  optimization  of  the  process.  Cold  compression  strength  (CCS), \nTumbler  index  (TI)  and  Abrasive  index  (AI)  being  the  important  strength  properties  of \npellets, are key to the improvement and optimization of the pelletization process. \nThis problem is a Multi output regression problem.

Plus  the  part  I  liked  the  most  was  that  the  internship  never/  very \nslightly affected my Vacation time thus allowing me learn other skills and perform various \ntasks without any interruption. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learnt a lot from PS-1- \nAcademically,  I  learnt  about  Harmonic  and  Cycloidal  gears in  detail.  I  learnt  basic \ndesigning in Inventor which will help me in future. I learnt how to work in a group- how to \ndivide  tasks,  how  to  help  each  other  out  etc.  The  Project  reports,  helped  boost  my \nresearch  and  writing  skills.  The  Group  Discussions,  Seminars,  Review  meets  helped \nimprove my communication and presentation skills. \n \n \n \n------------"

This  information  is  crucial  for  various  separation  processes  (like, \ndistillation)  and  obtaining  this  data  experimentally  is  expensive  and  time  consuming, \nwhich is why we made a predicting model for it. \nIn the first week we went through some concepts like VLE of Non-ideal solutions, Lewis-\nRandall rule, Activity Coefficients, Molecular Descriptors and Local Composition models \nfor activity coefficient (We used Non-Random Two Liquid (NRTL) model among the Local \nComposition  models).

There are several models based on local composition \n(like Wilson, NRTL, UNIFAC, UNIQUAC) but, we choose to work on NRTL model. \nMolecular descriptors represent the physical and chemical properties of the molecule with \nnumerical values (generated using ChEMBL and paDEL software). Using this we made \na  generalised  model  to  predict  NRTL  binary  interaction  parameters  in  python  using \nmachine  learning  techniques  (like  multiple  linear  regression,  logistic  regression  and \nartificial neural network etc), where molecular descriptors were independent variables and \nthe  binary  interaction  parameter  was  the  dependent  variable.  With  help  of  these \nparameters,  we  were  able  to  calculate  the  activity  coefficient  using  NRTL  model \nequations.

We also had to do comparative study to see \nwhy and which equipments to use and which not to use. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: We were not previously exposed to Iot subject by any way so it was \noverwhelming  at  first.  But  we  completely  manage  to  stick  by  the  timeline  and  give \nsatisfactory  work  and  presentation  to  our  company.  Faculty  and  mentors  were  helpfull \nand guided us very professionally. We were able to assemble the whole kit and code it \neven tho all team members were spread across country which was little tiring. My team \nwas very interactive and we had amazing coordination. It was a great experience overall.. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learnt a lot about Iot based project and future industry 4.0. I learnt \nhow  to  and  why  it's  the  future  of  this  generation.  I  got  so  much  better  at  presenting \nwhatever  I  have  to  present  and  also  at  group  discussions.  I  learnt  the  right  method  to \nresearch for any topic to start for any project. I learnt to work in team effectively. \n \n \n------------ \n \n\n180"

I  was  tasked \nwith  the  collection  of  information  pertaining  to  4  carbon  capture  technologies  namely \nAbsorption,  Adsorption,  Calcium  Looping  and  Chemical  Looping by  going  through \nresearch   articles   over   the   internet   from   reputed   sites   like   Science   Direct,   ACS \nPublications, RSC Publications, and Researchgate etc. Further, the information collected \nfrom  these  articles  was  tabulated  in  an  MS-Excel  Worksheet  which  encapsulated  the \ntechnology used (like Adsorption or Calcium Looping), author’s name, the journals name, \nthe  abstract  and  finally  the  advantages  of  using  the  technique  along  with  any  another \nrelevant  information  on  the  technologies.    I  did  the  above  set  of  tasks  for  about  100 \nresearch articles. After this, I was asked to analyze the information from the articles and \ndocument  the  suitability  and  pros  /  cons  of  each  technology  in  the  context  of  carbon \ncapture – this was documented in MS-Word. So, I had 2 deliverables – one, an MS-Excel \nWorksheet and two, an MS-Word document. \n \n \n \nPS-I experience: The project allotted to me on Carbon Capture & Storage was of interest \nto me given my interest in environmental sustainability in general. Also, given the Covid19 \npandemic, I was assigned a project based on secondary research on the Internet, which \nwas ideal given that I was not present at the PS-1 Station physically for the project. The \nIndustry Mentor I was allotted guided me in every way possible and cleared any doubt I \nhad in a simple & understandable manner. The work I was entrusted opened the doors \nof  research  articles  to  me  and  on  how  to  analyze and  get  relevant  information  from \nscientific research articles. The articles opened my eyes to the kind of technologies which \nare available to put a brake on pollution and global warming which have been on a rise \nover the last few decades in particular .The PS-1 Faculty Mentor (Satyapaul Singh Sir) \nhas been very helpful throughout the course of the PS programme & has always cleared \n\n198 \n \nmy doubts in a simplistic manner. Satyapaul Sir gave some really useful tips on how a \nreport is to be presented and also tips on how the skills could be improved in a GD by \ngiving a list of do’s and don’ts. The tips and guidance sir gave really helped me and will \nin my opinion greatly help me in the future as well. All in all I will like to say that my PS-1 \nexperience was quite a pleasant one. \n \n \nLearning  Outcome: To  be  completely  honest  the  PS-1  programme  was  a  great \nexperience  learning  wise.  It  taught  me  how  to  search  for  Research  Articles  which  has \nbeen always quite fascinating for me and my Industry Mentor guided me on how to do so \nusing appropriate key words to just get the kind of articles required. Another important \nlearning  was  learning  on  how  to  do  the  collation  of  relevant  information.  At  first  it  was \nquite  a  challenge  for  me  on  how  to  find  relevant  information  from  scientific  research \npapers, which were quite technical in nature, but over time I did get a hang of it and it was \na great learning experience. Another important learning was on how to match up to the \nwork  expectations.  PS-1  being  the  first  exposure  to  industry greatly  helped  me  in \nunderstanding on how to deal with expectations and being able to deliver what is required \nin the stipulated frame of time. Finally, the most important learning outcome to me was \nthe domain knowledge I gained in an area of emerging global importance. This project \nopened  up  the  world  of  Carbon  Capture  to  me,  which  is  one  of  the  most  important \ntechnologies  in  the  fight  against  climate  change,  especially  so  given  my  interest  in \nenvironmental sustainability which I also talked about earlier. \n \n \n------------"

Five \ncompounds of  therapeutic  value  from  plants  were  selected  and  their  properties  were \nstudied so as to classify them as nutraceuticals. Then we went over the isolation of genes \nand genome from the plants. Isolation of the genome is a common process done through \nDNA extraction and sequencing. Identification of genes responsible for the product were \nresearched  and  reviewed,  the  sequences  already  on  gene  databases  like  NCBI.  We \nfurther reviewed the recombination process, how to choose suitable plasmid vectors and \nhosts for the production of the desired gene products. Finally, we learnt how to check for \nthe production of products through analytical techniques. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  station  was  very  flexible  and  supportive  with  regards  to  the \ndomains that we wanted to work on, and it was my first exposure to the biotech industry. \nThe mentor was supportive as well, it was great to learn so much about recombination \ntechniques. \n \n \nLearning Outcome: I learnt a lot about the nutrition and nutraceuticals industry as well \nas the real life details of what goes into the process of DNA recombination to produce \ndesired gene products. \n \n \n------------"

We were given a dataset \nof COVID-19 affected hospital patients and were asked to perform clinical data analysis \non the same. Using data visualization and data analysis techniques in Python, we found \nsome patterns in the data and found features with a good predictive value for the outcome. \nAfter  data  preprocessing  and  identifying  useful  features,  we  implemented  5  machine \nlearning  models  using  nested  cross-validation  and  compared  their  performances.  We \nthen worked on writing a good manuscript - methodology, results and visualizations. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: It  was  a  great  experience,  as  I  got  to  learn  a  lot.  I  was  a  complete \nbeginner in Machine Learning and chose this station expecting to learn more about it and \nuse it for healthcare applications. In the initial stages, it was more about getting to know \nabout the organization and understanding how clinical research works through studying \nother research papers. We were then given a project idea that aligned with our area of \ninterest. We were given sufficient time to learn and come up with our own take on how to \nproceed with the project. I read articles online and took a few courses to understand how \nto go about doing the work. I applied what I had learned to the given dataset. We met with \nour  industry  mentor almost  weekly  and  talked  about  our  progress  and  presented  our \nfindings to him. After satisfactory progress with data analysis, we started with a draft of \nthe manuscript and through this got to learn about how to write a research paper. There \nwere regular meetings with our PS1 faculty mentor as well, where we updated him about \nour progress and reached out if we were facing any problems. We also had two group \ndiscussions  in  which  we  talked  about  relevant  problems  and  opportunities  in  the \nhealthcare and data science industry. \n \n \nLearning outcome: Through PS1, I learnt about data analysis and visualization, machine \nlearning, research and soft skills. I read articles online and took two courses on Coursera \n- Machine Learning by Andrew NG and Data Analysis using Python by IBM.  \nFor  data  analysis  and  visualization,  I  worked  with  Python  libraries  like  Pandas,  SciPy, \nNumPy,  Seaborn,  Matplotlib  and  Plotly.  We  learnt how  to  implement  nested  cross-\nvalidation  with  5  machine  learning  models - Logistic  Regression,  Support  Vector \nMachines,  XGBoost,  Multi-Layer  Perception  and  Random Forest  using  Scikit-Learn \n\n11 \n \nlibrary  in  Python.  We  were  introduced  to  how  clinical  research  works  through  the \nmanuscript. The group discussions and presentations enhanced our soft skills. \nA note here, it is completely up to you how much you learn and make of your experience, \nbased on your willingness to work and show interest in the project given by your mentor. \n \n \n------------"

Further,  we  pre-\nprocessed the data for using some of the amazing data visualization techniques due to \nwhich we were successfully able to create a wordcloud, bar plot, pie chart and dot line \ngraph for our dataset.

In addition to this, we were also able to create text networks including \nsome of the 3D text networks which depicted the word correlation among various type of \nwords accurately and precisely in the form of graphical networks. At the end, I was able \nto create a text analyzer package which we even uploaded on Github, and made it open \nsource, to make it publicly available for all. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: My  PS-1  experience  was  great.  The  project  was  challenging  and \nengaging enough to keep my interest till the end and even to add some of the new things \nto the project which we weren't asked, like including topic modelling concept and graphical \nnetworks as a part of NLP. Since, we were able to complete the project and upload it on \nGithub also, it feels great and I feel happy as anyone can use our package now. \n \n \nLearning outcome: I learnt R programming in a very great depth.

I feel that this PS-1 has helped me \napply the theoretical knowledge we had acquired in class rooms practically in a hands-on \nindustry manner. I feel that this experience has been enthralling and has taught me that \nthe  actual  work  that  the  company  requires  can  often  diverge  from  what  we  learnt in \nclassroom. It has taught me to look beyond the pages of a book to find the solutions to \nproblems and has drastically changed my perspective on the finance industry. It truly has \nbeen  an  eye-opener  and  this  newfound  industry  experience  has  certainly  opened  the \ndoors to future endeavours in the field finance. Working together as a team with my fellow \ninterns and functioning as single cohesive unit had been quite challenging at the start, but \nby the end of the internship, my leadership skills and the ability to play as a team had \nbeen sharpened. Thus, we seamlessly tore through all the obstacles and walls in our way! \nMy mentors were also very helpful and always helped satisfy my endless thirst for learning \nwith their endless ocean of knowledge.  \n\n47 \n \nLearning outcome: ● I learnt how to use excel to the fullest and the ability to integrate \nmultiple dynamic charts into the document seamlessly. \n● Learnt  the  functions  of  an  ERP  and  how  they  can  serve  as  a  valuable  asset  to  the \ncompany. \n● I honed my existing financial knowledge and became more comfortable in reading P&L \nstatements and balance sheets of a company. \n● I now have the expertise in MF portfolio analysis and the ability to successfully calculate \ntheir NAVs and weekly current values under my belt. \n● I understood how accrued interest can often accumulate  when the financial year has \ndifferent date from the maturity date of the Fixed Deposit. \n● Exposure to company - customer contracts. \n● I also became aware of the various practices in a company to ensure that the data is \nconfidential and prevent privacy information from leaking. I also became informed of the \nvarious spam practices and how data can be phished.  \n \n \n \n------------"

Since, Green  Gentem  is  a  startup, working  in  a  startup \nenvironment I experienced true collaboration. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: 1) The  legal  frame  work  of  WEEE  management  in  India - India \nhappens to be the only south Asian country to have a structured mechanism and laws for \nWEEE  management,  this  however  has  several  loopholes  resulting  in  competition \nbetween the formal (Authorized) sector and the informal sector, the government should \nwork towards incentivizing the formal sector. \n2) Learnt several features of MS Word & MS Excel I was earlier unaware of. \n3) New emerging techniques in WEEE management around the world. \n4) My communication skills have also improved from all the calling to MNSc/NGOs and \nrecyclers that we did. \n5) Collaboration & team work. \n6) Functioning of a startup.  \n7) WEEE  market  and  the  wide  scope  it  has  with  the  exponentially growing  figures  of \nelectronic waste generation every year. \n \n \n------------"

Overall,  it  would  have  been \nbetter  in  offline  mode  where  we  would  have  been  able  to  look  into  their  days  and \ncontribute to the team more effectively but given the conditions, the PS- I experience was \ngood. \n \n \nLearning outcome: My domain being business analysis, there were majorly three things \nthat I learnt in terms of technical skills, which are: \nAdvanced Excel- Excel is a very resourceful tools if used right, it is very easy to analyse \nvarious small datasets intuitively and interactively right from excel itself. \nBusiness acumen- Before analysing the data sets the most recurring questions that needs \nto be asked is \"How will the analysis align with the business goals\" and this becomes the \nbase of the entire analysis. \nPython- Analysis  non-repetitive  and  random  data  sets  is  not  possible  with  standalone \nanalysation tools. Python comes handy when these data sets are needed to be analysed \nand makes the process efficient and easy. \nOther than these technical skills, some primary skillsets like communication, team work, \nadaptability were something that were automatically acquired during the PS- I tenure. \n \n \n------------"

The  app  has  retrofit  api  and \nlibraries. \n \n \nPS-I experience: It  was  great  experience  for  me.  Even  though  it  got  bit  hectic \nbecause of having 2 projects, I learnt lot from it. The NIRDPR team was very helpful and \nguided me in great way. The 1st project was pretty straight forward but helped learn a lot \nof new technologies like flutter. The 2nd project was challenging. I was continuously touch \nwith the Director and he also helped me lot with connecting with many professionals and \nexperts from the field. \n \n \nLearning outcome: 1) Learnt  Android  development 2) Team  work 3) Problem  solving \n4) Perseverance 5) Testing  using  Android  studio 6) Debugging  using  Android  studio  \n7) API testing with Postman \nOverall, PS developed a sense of confidence to learn and implement our skills on any \nreal life projects. \n \n \n------------ \n\n159"

            "writeUp": "Student write-up  \n \nShort summary of work done: The objective of the project was to understand the current \nstate of digital literacy in rural India, identify gaps and bottlenecks in the current state of \nrural digital literacy through internet research and data analysis, along with surveys and \neventually coming up with plausible solutions regarding the same. This project had three \nmajor components - internet research, an associated survey and data analysis. It involved \nan  in-depth  research  about  the  overall  status  of  digital  literacy  in  rural  India  including \nDigital  Literacy,  Technology  Adoption,  Information  Communication  Technology,  Digital \nDivide, Rural Digital Literacy and Role of Digital Literacy in SDGs. On the basis of this \nresearch,  the data  obtained  was  utilized for preparing  a  questionnaire  consisting  of  45 \nquestions. Using this questionnaire, conducted 100 telephonic and face-to-face surveys \nas a part of 3 membered team during the tenure and presented the granular data gathered \nfrom  these.  The  data  collected  from  these  100  surveys  was  documented  and  logical \nconclusions  were  drawn  from  these.  There  were  observed  notable  changes  in  the \npatterns of shift of rural India towards the empowerment tools available for use and digital \ndelivery   methods   along   with technology   awareness   bringing   about   an   overall \ntransformation.  Rural  India  is  definitely  taking  a  step  closer  to  digital  literacy.  It  was \ninteresting  to  notice  that  the  country  at  large  is  pivoting  towards  digital  services, \ntechnologies  and  towards  digital  literacy  in  general.  Digital  awareness  and  adoption  is \ngenuinely more than what could have been imagined. \n \n \nPS-I  experience: The  experience  of  conducting  this  survey  was  enriching,  insightful, \nknowledge  imparting  giving  a  holistic  understanding  about  the existing  challenges  in \ndigital literacy in rural India. However, while conducting these surveys, certain challenges \n\n163 \n \nwere  faced  which  included  the  fact  that  surveys  are  mostly  conducted  face-to-face  on \nhard copy basis but this survey had to be conducted on a remote basis in a digital manner \nusing excel sheets. While conducting a telephonic survey, one needs to refer to the list of \ndirectories, and these directories have certain wrong or unupdated numbers. There are \ncertain people who never pick up calls from unknown numbers, even if some of them will \npick  up  the  calls,  they  will  disconnect  the  call  immediately  dismissing  as  spam  callers. \nThen, in the middle of the survey, there are certain times when its often hard to convince \npeople  to  answer  certain  questions  or  keep  the  momentum  of  the  survey  going  till  the \nend.  Even  if  one  convinces  people  to  answer  the  questions,  some  people  skip  certain \nquestions,  there  are  certain  times  when  people  hesitate answering  some  questions \nconsidering them as confidential ones or often providing misleading / wrong information. \nAdditionally,  there  might  be communication  gap  from  the  end  of  the  interviewer,  who \nmight be going too slow or too fast or there might be network issues from both the ends, \nwhich may make the voice break leading to discontinuity in the survey. The data analysis \ninvolves the use of graphs - pie charts and bar graphs, depending upon the number of \nquestions  and  the  number  of  responses  recorded  and  type  of  response  which  was \nprovided by the respondents. \n \n \nLearning  outcome: The  industry  experience  gathered  will  be  useful  in  opening  a \nfloodgate of opportunities in terms of what digitisation has to offer to the people of rural \nareas, widening their horizons. During this project, the major learnings were managing, \nleading a team and communicating with the stakeholders, conducting surveys to validate \nour hypothesis - involving first data gathering and then preparing a relevant questionnaire \nand then subsequently contacting the right stakeholders - to get detailed understanding \nof  the  prevailing  situation,  along  with  time  management  to  manage  deadlines  and \nensuring  work  gets  done  before  time  throughout  the  entire  process.  Additionally,  also \nlearnt  the  technical  skills  of  conducting  remote  surveys,  gathering  stakeholder’s data, \ndocumenting this data and then using the relevant software for plotting graphs and then \nusing  these  plotted  graphs  to  come  to  logical  conclusions  against  the  gathered \ninformation.  Therefore,  the  overall  learnings  were  communication  skills,  people skills - \nwhere one needs to be apt to modify the questionnaire if required, documentation skills \nand analysis skills. \n \n \n------------"

To  create  output,  I  required  to \nutilize GIS software. After comprehending the idea of the industry mentor, which was to \nmap schools, bus stops, ATM's, hospitals, population and other data points essential to \nPARC. I began working on it. The main issue was extracting data, which was exacerbated \nby the fact that I also wanted to extract coordinates of locations. The main problem got \nsolved  when  I  learnt about  technology  called  web  scrapper.  Using  this  method,  the \nprocess  was  automated,  saving  over  700  hours  of  work  while  maintaining  data  quality \nand ensuring zero errors.

After this, we test out various combinations of these names@domain.com \nand then use an email validator which we built to see which ones are legit emails. These \nemails are then uploaded to a CSV file and then the team can use it for marketing. \n2) Web analyser - The  second  project  that  we  worked  on  is  to  analyse  websites \ncompletely (all the URLs, H1 tags, Meta tags, etc) and see why certain page is doing so \nwell on google search page (SERP). We analyze various keywords present on a page, \nthis  gives  us good  grip  on  what  pages  we  are  missing.  These  pages  and  the  required \nkeywords can then be added to our website / client website to keep up with the competing \nwebsites.

The 2nd assignment of the project involved \nformulating an Employee Engagement Touchpoint Roadmap, which would help Suzlon \ncommunicate  effectively  about  its  culture  transformation  to  its  employees.  The  only \nconstraint was that the solutions had to be implementable within a year since roll out. To \nensure that the entire process of culture transformation was smooth and tailor made for \neach employee, I divided all the employees firstly on the basis of tenure of work at Suzlon \n(i.e.  new  recruits,  employees  with  moderate  experience  and  employees  at  managerial \nlevels)  and secondly on the basis of mode of work (i.e. work from office / home or on-site \nemployees)  and  provided  solutions  specific  to  these  communication  categories.
