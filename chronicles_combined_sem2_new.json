Currently  modelling  is  being  done  by  extracting  online  data, \nfollowed by modelling of this offline data. The developed model is then applied on the process. \nThus,  it  would  be  efficient  if  modelling  would  be  done  online.  Regression  techniques that  are \nused for online estimation and control generally yield poor models if the data is not rich enough. \nIn this report a modified block-wise dynamic recursive PLS technique that is based on selection \nof  rich  data  has  been  studied  for  online  adaptation and  control.  Because  of  its  ability  to \naccommodate a wider range of forgetting factors, the technique is found to track the dynamics \nof slow as well as fast changes in the processes. The reviewed algorithm has been studied with \nrespect to the carbon black process. In an effort to self-tune the carbon black process, a deeper \nunderstanding of the reviewed technique has been done by reviewing the basic techniques such \nas  Principle  component  analysis,  partial  least  square  technique  and  recursive  partial  least \nsquare  technique  along  with  an  in-depth  review  of  the  carbon  black  process  itself.  The \nmethodology  towards  achieving  the  goal  of  self-tuning  has  also  been  proposed  along  with  a \nfuture vision to attain more clarity. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : matlab, ms office, origin \n \nObjectives of the project : • To understand Regression and its different types   • To  understand \ndata analysis • To study different self tuning methods and their algorithm • To    analyze    Matlab \ncodes for previously developed tuning methods • To  develop  a  Matlab  code for  self  tuning of \ncarbon black process (mainly reactor) • To  model  the  real  time  plant  dataset  using  Partial \nLeast square Regression and  Modified Partial Least square Regression . • To compare \ntheir predictive capability. \n \n\n37 \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : • The  modification  made  in  the  forgetting  factor  calculation \ngives better results. \n• Month by month addition of new datasets allows us to view change in model adaptation. \n• From the given graphs it can be concluded that  Modified Block-wise Recursive PLS is \nbetter at model adaptation as compared to Partial Least Square Regression because: \no Model adaptation is faster \no Error from the actual values is smaller. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company :  \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Process Modelling"

It  has  a  data  of  different  attributes  related  to  pharma  and \n\n68 \n \nsome  FMCG  products  and  Ascent  had  a  data  for  around  2.2  lakh  products.  The  entire  data \nrelated to these products are stored in Master Data Management (MDM). So different distributer \nand retailers have their own data base where they can record details of products but MDM as a \nmaster maintains the data of each product with a unique code to each product, MDM acts as a \nsingle source of truth by standardizing the data and incorporated rules in order to find incorrect \ndata, new rules are made with some logics and algorithms to find the incorrect data and helps to \nidentify  the  products  with  issues,  these  products  with  issues  should  be  cleaned  by  Data \nGovernance Team (DGT), along with cleaning process DGT also works on Mapping, Levelling, \nQuality Checks etc. The data in MDM should be validated by some professionals so as a part of \nDRX-Doctor’s  Program  doctors  are  hired  to  validate  required  data  in  MDM.  MDM  system  is \ncritical  for  analytics,  financial  reporting,  customer  management,  customer  care,  compliance, \nproduct regulatory adherence, cross-selling and up-selling between the warehouses and ensure \nsmooth supply chain management .Finally, Resource Scoring Framework was done in order to \nstandardize  the  Data  governance  team  to  give  One  Agent  One  Score  (OAOS).  OAOS  was \nimplemented  based  on  the  performance  of  each  member  by  considering  few  parameters  of \neach team member such as Quality, Efficiency, Adherence, Utilization, Knowledge etc. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : SQL, DATA EDO, AWS \n \nObjectives of the project : To help in building a better medicine master by getting doctors as \nconsultants and work with Data Governance Team in order to improve the quality of the data we \nhave  and  help  to  build  a  robust  and  through  validation  layer  of  Master  Data  Management.  To \ncreate  new  Health  Metric  tests to  improve  the  quality  of  the  data  in  Master  Data  Management \n(MDM).  Creation  of  Resource  Scoring  framework  based  on  the  performance  of  the  team \nmember of Data Governance Team. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : • DATA  EDO  is  a  tool  where  I  had  written  the  table  and \ncolumn description to each attribute related to products and their related entity. Which acts as a \nmeta data helps for internal purposes and for third party. \n• I  had  written  STANDARD  OPERATING  PROCEDURES  (SOP)  for  the  validation  of \nattributes which helps the DGT team to understand the procedure for validation of attributes. \n• I had written the reference documents for the 2 attributes which helps the DGT team to \nrefer the documents for further reference. \n\n69 \n \n• Came  up  with  the  new  Health  Metric  test  which  helps  the  DGT  team  to  identify  the \nmanufacturer, measurement, schedule related details. \n• As  a  part  of  DRX- Program  onboarded  4  doctors  as  a  consultant  to  the  organisation \nwhich helps the DGT team in validating the data. \n• Guided Quality Check Team and Cleared a small concepts to them and helped them to \nminimise the products failing Health metric. \n• Making  dashboards  helps  the  DGT  team  to  understand  the  complete  data  on  sight. \nMaking this dashboard twice a week which give the summary of the entire data. \n• Recently started working on resource framework i.e One Agent One Score (OAOS) and \ncontinuously working on it to improve and standardise this. Helps to understand the area where \nthe agent is really week and helps management to give training to a agent in a particular area. \nThis is at a pilot level and will expand soon. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment is really good and can really learn new things \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : DOSAGE FORM DESIGN"

To  accomplish  this,  we \ndescribe a novel “semantic infusion” method, which infuses special marker strings in the word \nvector space of the text, in order to locate these trending terms. We also demonstrate the power \nof  our  method  by  comparing  its  results  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  with  those  of  a  well-\nestablished  algorithm,  the  Online  Processing  Variant  of  LDA.  We  outline  a  few  industrial \napplications for our method which were tested so far. We then shift our focus to a different area \nof interest at Bosch: prediction of product recall incidents from complaints data of automobiles. \nIn  this  task,  we  focus  on  developing  a  usable  dataset,  using  a  set  of  rules  applied  to  existing \ncomplaint and recall data. We build a deep neural network classifier, pass this dataset to it, and \naim to predict if a complaint against an automobile will result in its recall or not. We provide our \nresults and a short analysis of our observations from it. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Python, Keras library, Word2Vec \n \nObjectives of the project : 1) Develop an automated method of extracting the trends from the \ncorpus by introducing the concept of semantic trends.  2)  Compare semantic trend results with \nthe results of a well-established trend analysis algorithm, Online Processing Variant of LDA, to \nestablish  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  improvement  of  the  semantic  infusion  technique.  3) \nDevelop  a  classifier, specifically  a  bidirectional  Long  Short-Term  Memory  to  identify  whether  a \ncomplaint is severe enough to warrant a recall of the product.  4) Prepare a dataset which can \nbe directly used by the classifier, and observe how the predictive power of the model changes \nwhen it is trained with data from different time window sizes. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : 1)  Performing  experiments  to  test  the  quality  of  results  from  an \nalgorithm.  \n2) Documenting the complete project into a paper for a conference. \n3) Preparing a dataset from existing resources to supply to a classifier.  \n4) Building a deep learning model to classify text. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : Submitted a paper to CIKM 2019. \n \n\n81 \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment  was  relaxed.

The  objective  of  the \ncurrent study was twofold (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient between finger and glass substrate using the strain gauge-based sensor. The role of \ndifferent  parameters  such  as  stroke  frequency,  Uni  vs  bi-directional  stroke, static  friction  was \nstudied. Protocol parameters were recommended to better differentiate the systems with smaller \ndifference  in  COF.    (2)  the  second  part  of  the  work  focuses  on  the  impact  of  different  factors \nsuch  as  surfactant  types,  pH,  alkalinity,  viscosity,  ionic  strengths  and  skin  hydration  on  the \nfriction  coefficient.  Ionic  and  nonionic  surfactants  were  chosen  for  the  study,  namely:  (a) \nAnionic:  NaLAS,  SDS,  SLES,  MES,  SLI,  (b)  Cationic:  CPC,  CTAB,  (c)  Zwitterionic:  CAPB  and \n(d) Non-ionic: EO7 and Lutensol XL 60. Non-ionic surfactant showed higher frictional coefficient. \nAmong  the  anionic  surfactants,  the  COF  trends  were  SDS<Na-LAS<  MES=SLES<SLI.  The \ntrend  was  explained  using  the  CMC  and  packing  parameter  of  surfactants  at  the  air/water \ninterface.  Cationic  and  anionic  surfactants  of  comparable  CMC  showed  similar  COF.  pH \nexperiments showed COF was primarily governed by the reserved alkalinity of the system and \nnot the pH. E.g., for same pH, sodium carbonate gave lower COF than sodium hydroxide. Skin \nhydration  shows  a  maximum  in  COF.  Viscosity  decreased  the  COF  which  was  in  line  with  the \n\n189 \n \nlearning  from  Stribeck  curve  that  the  viscosity  increase  shifts  the  lubrication  regime  from \nboundary to hydrodynamic regime. \n \nTool   used   (Development   tools - H/w,   S/w) : Strain  gauge  load  cell   based   sensors, \nfluorescence spectrometer, dynamic surface tensiometer, python and Matlab codes for analysis \n \nObjectives of the project : (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient  between  finger and  glass  substrate  using  the  strain  gauge-based  sensor.

These  models  are  used  for  both  heating  and  cooling \napplications.  Micro-channel  Heat  Exchanger(MCHX)  is  used  in  the  indoor  side  of  these  units. \nMCHX  is  either  used  as  an  evaporator  or  an  condenser  depending whether  the  heat  pump \nsystem  is  in  cooling  or  heating  mode  respectively.  The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  increase  the \ncapacity  of  MCHX.  It  is  achieved  by  increasing  the  air  side  Heat  transfer  Coefficient.  Air  side \nheat  transfer  coefficient  can  be  increased  by adding  fins  or  creating  rough  surfaces.  In  this \nProject air side heat transfer is enhanced by adding surface roughness (in the form of grooves). \nA  small  part  of  MCHX  is  modelled  in  creo,  to  analyze  the  present  heat  transfer  and  pressure \ndrop in ANSYS Fluent. This modelled MCHX is imported into ANSYS Workbench and simulated \nin  ANSYS  Fluent  to  calculate  the  present  heat  transfer  and  pressure  drop.  From  the  solution \nreports  it  can  be  observed  that  because  of  grooves  there  is  improvement  in  heat  transfer \ncoefficient by 5% due to increase in effective surface area. The increase in pressure drop from \nplain-tube to grooved-1-tube was found to be 2.9% because of increased turbulence. But from \nplain-tube-surface  to  grooved-2-tube-surface  the  pressure  drop  increase  was  only  1.19% \nbecause grooved-2 profile was little rougher and had more surface area than grooved-1 profile. \nTherefore  Grooved-2-tube-surface  can  be  selected  for  optimum  heat  transfer  and  pressure \ndrop. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Creo, ANSYS Fluent \n \nObjectives of the project : Improvement in Performance of Micro-channel Heat Exchanger \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learnt  about  heat  exchangers,  Gained  practical  knowledge  on \nheat pump systems \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : -Nil \n \n\n204 \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company : Very Friendly \nmanagement, flexible working hours \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Heat Transfer, Refrigeration and air-conditioning"

The purpose of \ndoing synthesis is to convert the RTL code of module to technology dependent optimized netlist, \nit minimizes the slack to meet the timing performance and also, it minimizes area and leakage \npower.  In  this  project,  synthesis  of  a  module  has  been  performed  using  Synopsys  Design \nCompiler. After applying appropriate constraints on a module, slack has been minimized to 0ns \nfrom 1.586ns and leakage power has been minimized to 1.652μW. \nAlso,  the  other  part  of  work  includes  clock  domain  crossing  (CDC)  check  which  has  been \nperformed on chip top level using Questa CDC tool. The intention of performing CDC check on \nchip top level is to make sure that the data exchange between different clock domains is smooth \nand functionally  correct.

It gave an industrial exposure and an experience of the real \nworld scenario suitable for my technical background. After having spent a duration of five and a \nhalf months  at  my  PS - II  station,  Netskope  Inc.,  can  positively  say  that  I  have  gained  a  lot  of \nconfidence and expertise to face the challenges in the industrial world. \nThe Work mostly comprised of improving the features/bugs in their major products which led me \nto gain the knowledge of how the code is written at the production level. I was also given work in \nthe Dev-Ops field. I also had to write many flask applications which  were wrappers for various \nother cloud applications. You get to learn about the cloud applications, networking a lot in this \ncompany. I was also involved in the creation of an Employee Recognition Portal which was for \nthe HR team. \nApart from the project PS-II also gives us industrial exposure. I learnt how coding standards are \nin an industrial environment. Modulation of the code is of utmost importance. This is because a \nmajor concern of the institutions is scalability of the code. The code should remain usable even \nafter  a  particular  person  is  off  the  project.  It  should  be  understandable  to  everyone.  Thus, \nvariable  names,  packages,  documentation  etc. need  to follow  certain  rules  as  specified  by  the \ncompany. \nIn an industrial environment, essional conduct is also of a lot of importance. PS-II gave me an \nexposure  to  this  area  as  well.  Addressing  your  colleagues  and  documenting  all  conversations \nvia emails is very important in a work environment. \n\n281 \n \nAs it was my first exposure to IT culture and this programme helped me in every possible way to \nmake transition from an all-academic environment to an industrial environment. Five and a half \nmonths is optimum time to get acquainted with these changes. PS-II broadened my knowledge \nand boosted a lot of confidence in me. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Linux, Ansible, SSH, Flask, AWS-SAM, SignalFx, \nBootstrap, Celery \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : 1)  Automate  the  process  of  VM  provisioning,  2)  Add  SignalFx \nmetrics for SLO tracking, 3) Create an Employee Recognition Portal. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learning Flask, Ansible, SignalFx, Bootstrap, Celery, AWS-SAM \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : No Research Paper and patents were made or referred as it was \nsoftware development work. \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  work \nenvironment of the company is amazing. The people are really helpful and sincere in their work. \nThey listen to your doubts however silly they might be and try to solve them and all of them are \napproachable. There are regular knowledge transfer sessions which helps in listening to others’ \nwork  and  what  problem  they  are  facing  and  how  they  solved  it  this  leads  to  recognising  the \nproblem if faced by you in the future and then you can solve it yourself only. \nThe  company  is  a  start-up  and  this  is  the  main  reason  why  the  place  is  so  amazing.  The \nbusiness is doing well and thus is attracting new talents from top institutions and have a healthy \nenvironment. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Cloud Computing, Computer Networking"

You'll get to learn a lot and have great fun while doing so. One thing that stood out for me \nis that, even as an intern, you are given similar responsibility as any full-time employee and your \nwork has directly impact on the tools/services Qubole offers. This greatly aides one's learning, in \nmy opinion, and also gives the satisfaction of doing important/meaningful work. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project : Parallel  Computing,  Data  Structures  and \nAlgorithms, Cloud Computing"

The solution \nwas  chosen  such  that  it  provided  the  most  efficient  sections  in  terms  of  stresses  at  ultimate \nstage  and  deflections  at  service  stage.  Any  typical  floor  was  divided  into  spans  of  11m  x  11m \nconsisting  of  primary  beams  and  secondary  beams  supported  on columns  at the  corners. The \nsection  of  primary  and  secondary  beams  were  designed  as  per  ArcelorMittal  ABC  Software \npackage  considering  the  composite  action  of  slab,  ensured  by  providing  one  row  of  shear \nconnectors welded to the beams. Connections were designed using OSDAG software package. \nFor  achieving  efficiency  and  economy  the  column  section  was  varied  along  the  height  of  the \nbuilding  by  decreasing the  thickness  of the  plate,  along  the  height  of  the  building. To  simulate \nthe structure so as to get accurate behavior, the structure was modelled as a three dimensional \nsteel-concrete  composite  ordinary  moment-resisting  frame  with  RCC  ductile  Shear  walls  in \nETABS:  2016  and  structural  performance  report  was  prepared.

To  review  the \nproposed design by preparing a structural performance report. To prepare the bill of quantities \nfor a typical 11m x11m bay. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The program introduced me to the newly emerging field of “Steel-\nConcrete Composite Structures\".

A model \nwas  developed  for movement to  and from  DELHI,  KOLKATA  and  MUMBAI,  by  using  inter-city \nand  sub-urban  trains. A  cost  model  was  developed  for  Mumbai sub-urban  train  movement,  of \nwhich,  a  pilot  run  was  done  by  me  in  February  and  March,  2020.  Efficiency  of  this  movement \nwas increased by bringing about change in the original plan and with the help of Indian railways. \nI  learned  about  Amazon  and  Indian  railways  network  and  how  these  can  be  intertwined  for \nbenefit of both.

We underwent a 10 day training at warehouses, \nsort centers  and delivery centers  of  Amazon  to  better understand  the  network.  After  which  we \nwere allotted our project. People at amazon are very helpful if you are interested to learn. The \nbest part is that they will only show us a way of solving a problem and will not spoon feed us. \nWe have to try out things, make mistakes and learn. Also, amazon has an excellent work culture \nas  the  people  are  very  welcoming,  treating  the  interns  as  a  part  of  the  team  like  any  other \nemployee  rather than  as  outsiders.

First  was  to redesign  the  delivery  bags  used in  Amazon \nprime  now.  We  had  some  major  issues  with  the  current  design  such  as  bad  food  non-food \nsegregation  mechanism,  no  adequate  space  for  bar  code  labels,  dark  inner  color  of  the  bag, \nbag unable to stand upright i.e. be stable when kept in a trolley for picking order products etc. In \norder  to  solve  the  problems,  I  performed  a  cost  effectiveness  analysis  between  the  reusable \nbags  and  the  previously  used  brown  bags  as  a  result  of  which  reusable  bags  came  out  to  be \ncheaper.  I then  performed  one  on  one  interaction  with  various  on  field  employees  and  then \ncame up with solutions with the help of my manager. We introduced three pouches on the inner \nwalls  of  the  bag  (back,  left  and  right)  instead  of  the  previous  rigid  mid  partition.  We  also \ndedicated  spaces  for  bar  code  scanning  labels,  changed  the  inner  color  to  lime  yellow  for \nvisibility and gave a PVC cardboard support in the lower 25% of the bag to make it stand upright \ni.e. stable when kept in trolley for picking. I also improved the temperature sustainability of our \nchilled bags by providing better insulation and reducing the number of gel packs used. This also \nreduced the overall weight of the chilled bags. As my second project, I created a robust quality \nand  social  distancing audit  mechanism  for  Prime  now  that  helps  the  central  team  to  identify \nprocess  misses,  compliance  gaps  and  other  improvement  opportunities.  I  also  created  an \nautomated  tool  using  python  language  of  programming  (pandas  library)  to  automate  the  audit \nreport generation  process.  This  tool  reduced  the  time  required  for  report  generation  from  7-8 \nhours / week to 15-20 minutes / week. \n \n\n74 \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Jupyter  Notebook  (Python  and  Pandas),  Excel \nand other internal Amazon tools. \n \nObjectives of  the  project: The  objective  of  redesigning  reusable  bags  project  was  to  a \ncomprehensive analysis of cost difference of paper bags vs reusable bags and to identify gaps \nin  the  current  design  of  reusable  bags  and  come  up  with  a  better  design  to  resolve  all  these \nissues. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Negotiation  skills,  Excel,  Document  writing  in  Amazon,  Python \nlanguage of programming (Pandas library), Cost effectiveness analysis, Designing of products, \nAutomation of mechanical activities and Amazon's leadership principles. \n \nDetails  of  papers / patents: My  patent  for  the  bag  redesigning  project  consists  of  the \nintroduction of three pockets in the back, left and right inner sides of the bad instead of the mid \npartition, dedicated spaces for bar scanner labels, introduction of PVC cardboard at the bottom. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment in Amazon is great. Some of the key highlights from employees point of view are \nwork hours flexibility and dressing flexibility. Amazon corporate offices are greatly built and has \nsome great facilities for the employees.

It is fun to see how all Amazonians \nlive by these 14 principles on every action we perform. When it comes to the expectations from \nthe  company,  Amazon  expects  us  to  firstly  follow  these  14  leadership  principles  by  all  means \nand  then  perform  our  projects  efficiently.  Amazon  promises  to  be the  most  customer-centric \ncompany  ever  and  hence  we  start  with  our  customers,  with  customer  satisfaction  and  move \nbackwards.

The task is to find the size building which is \nmost  cost-efficient  for  the  2 h delivery  model.  We  have  updated  the  design  principles  that \ndetermine  the  right  building  sizes.  The  result  is  the  size  of  a  building  that  would  minimize  the \ncost per unit and at the same time be feasible to be launched in the city regions. This building \nplan  has  evolved  over  the  former  model,  identifying  all  the  involved  costs.  The  work  also \nfocuses on how the cost change with the size of the building. \n2.Rate  Model - Business  requirement  sheets  (BRS)  provide  detailed  information  about  all  the \ndesign aspects of a specific building. They take in outbound volume as input and provide all the \n4Ms / Manpower / Shelving  as  cube etc.  as  an  output.  The  current  sheets  are  static  and  only \nportray  the  requirements  of  an  FC  for  a  given  outbound  volume.  The  idea  is  to  develop  a \ndynamic rate model using excel that would give all the elements and cost structure to make the \nFCs, depending on the Output and productivity. \n3.Ideal  Building  Costing  and  Sizing  (LPC) - There  are  two  types  of  buildings  in  the  UFF \nbusiness- FC  and  Hub / Live  Processing  centers  (LPC).  Taking  cues  from  the  methodology \nadopted for FCs, we have extended the model to Hub/LPCs. They are storage centers that are \npresent one leg before the Fresh FCs.

Also, the experiments done for the second project helped in reducing \nthe  misses  at  the  site  due  to  miss-staging  which  was  one  of  the  major  blockers  in  the \nimprovement of the performance of the site. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: It was a great \nexperience  working with Amazon for 5 months. The company gave me immense opportunities \nto  work  upon  my  soft  skills  alongside  technical  and  management  skills.  I  was  exposed  to  a \nvariety of situations and had ample opportunity to scale up my leadership and decision making \nabilities.   This   has   helped   me   become   an   effective   people   manager   and   improved   my \ncommunication  abilities.  Also,  the  projects  were  quite  challenging  in  nature  and  it  would  have \nnot been completed within the prescribed time without the constant help and guidance from my \nmentor, manager and other operations managers. All of them were very supportive and helped \nin  clearing  every  doubts  that  I  had.  The  student-to-working  professional  transition  could  not \nhave been smoother and I'm privileged enough to explore the depths of my project while at the \nsame  time gaining  useful  insights  into  Amazon's business  in  India.  Overall,  it  has  been  a  very \npleasant and smooth experience interning at AMAZON. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Yes,  Supply  chain management  and  production \nplanning control helped me in the projects."

Items that are accepted at the FC \nand  get  damaged  before  shipping  are  termed  as  warehouse  damage.  Warehouse  damage \ncosts  the  FC  in  terms  of  seller  reimbursements.  It  also  affects  ability  of  FC  in  delivering  the \ncustomer order within promised time. At the FC, the products are kept in shelves in small units \ncalled  bins.  A  bin had  physical  inventory  and  a  virtual  record  of  it.  When  a  customer  places \norder,  it  gets  attached  to  products  in  specific  bin,  and  only  that  bin  can  be  used  to  fulfill  it. \nHence,  it  is  critically  important  that  physical  items  and  virtual  records  agree  all  the  time.  A \nsource of mismatch in these is when a product falls down from a bin. This is called an amnesty \nitem.  Amnesty  costs  the  FC  in  terms  of  manpower  allocated  to  rectify  the  mismatch,  risk  to \ncustomer promise and possibility of product getting damaged due to the impact. In this project, I \nanalysed  various  processes in  FC  involving  inventory  movement.  From  this, I  found  out  1 \nstructural  improvement,  1  process  fail  points,  1  improvement  area  for  human  errors.  For  the \nprocess  fail  point,  I  recommended  a  tool  modification,  which  has  potential  to  reduce  25%  of \nwarehouse  damage.  From  the  improvement  process  of  human  errors,  we  are  seeing  ~30% \ndecrease  in  WD  in  that  process.  Also,  I  planned 1  structural  improvement  to  reduce  amnesty \nwhich would be acted upon in near future. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Excel, Powerpoint, SQL. \n \nObjectives of the project: Warehouse damage reduction, Amnesty reduction. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Managed  to  get  domain  knowledge  in  following  areas - Shift \nManagement,   Process   analysis,   Structural   improvement   implementation   planning,   Tool \ndesigning. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Nil. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: This is a field \njob.

Amazon  faces  a  problem of  loss / theft  of  mobile \nphones  in  it's  supply / delivery  chain.  To  mitigate  this  problem,  this  project  aimed  at  digitally \nlocking / unlocking  mobile  phones  when  they  are  in  transit  so  that  even  if  they  are  stolen,  the \nmobile phones are not usable. My  work was to implement a backend automated workflow that \nwould be triggered by events such as delivery event, return event, etc. and perform operations \non remote devices through API calls for locking / unlocking them. The project was implemented \nonly  for  Samsung  mobile  phones  as  currently,  only  Samsung  provides  the  functionality  to \ndigitally lock mobile phones through their Knox program. The project consisted of a forward leg \nin which the phone is ordered through Amazon and delivered to the customer and a reject leg in \nwhich  a  phone  order  is  rejected  by  the  customer  and  it  is  returned  back  to  an  Amazon  FC. \n\n116 \n \nSamsung  Knox  required  that  the  phone  was  enrolled  in  their  database  before  any  locking / \nunlocking operations, so the forward leg requirement was to enroll the mobile phone when it is \nout  for  delivery  and  unenroll  it  when  it  is  delivered  to  the  customer.  Also,  if  the  phone  is  not \ndelivered within 10 days from the day it was shipped, it is considered lost or stolen and it has to \nbe locked. In the reject leg, when the phone starts it's journey back to the warehouse, it has to \nbe locked and then it is unlocked when it reaches the warehouse. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java, AWS tools such as SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, \nCloudFormation, CloudWatch, Lambda, CDK, S3, etc. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  design  an  automated  workflow \nthat  gets  triggered  on internal  Amazon  events  such  as  delivery  event, reject  event,  etc.  and \nperforms  operations  on  remote  devices  to  digitally  lock  and unlock  them  when  they  are  in \ntransit. \nMajor learning outcomes: Proficiency in  Java,  Dagger,  Junit,  Design  patterns, Proficiency  in \nAWS tools such as DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Lambda. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief   description   of   working environment,   expectations   from   the   company: In   my \ninternship at Amazon, I felt more like a full-time SDE taking an active part in my team's projects \nand   day-to-day   tasks.   Team   members   were   extremely   helpful   and   inclusive.   I   had   an \nexponential  learning  curve  because  all  the  tools  were  new  to  me.  However,  there  was  a  lot of \npressure from the manager for completing the project as it this project had a significant business \nimpact and a very strict timeline.

Java  Spring  MVC - I  knew  a  little  bit  of  Java  before  this \ninternship,  but  had  never  worked  on  any  large  scale  Java  codebase.  I  got  to  know  about \nannotations, Spring MVC functionalities and how it has made development a lot easier. \n2. Kotlin and android - I explored a lot in this domain as I had no knowledge and the task was a \nlittle complex. I got a great exposure on an activity, its lifecycle and learnt Kotlin along the way. \n3. Frontend stack - I had not worked on HTML or CSS before. I got to know the working and a \nlittle hands-on experience as well by adding the RTL support. \n \n\n118 \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment  of  Amazon  is  really  good.  The  people  are  really  supportive  and  will  help  you  get \non-boarded comfortably.

The cashback can be \ngratified either immediately after the order has been confirmed or after the shipment has been \ndispatched. A major issue with issuing cashback is when any cancellation occurs. An order can \nbe cancelled after the order has been placed until the order has been shipped. Once the order \ngets  shipped  it  cannot  be  cancelled  but  it  can  be  returned.  When  cashback  has  been  issued \nafter  the  order  is  confirmed  and then the  order gets  cancelled,  we  observe  abuse  cases  while \nclawing back issued cashback when the cancellation workflow goes through OMA or PCE. This \nproblem  can  be  side-stepped  by  having  a  mechanism  which  can  pre-determine  the  cashback \nfulfillment  issuance  level.

I first had to establish the tenets and choose the \nmost  compatible  frontend  framework  accordingly.  Then,  setup  the  pipeline  and  packages \nrequired  for  the  purpose  of  hosting  the  UI  and  setup  the  necessary  AWS  infrastructure  for \ncommunication between the frontend and the backend where the tool resides. Finally, complete \nall the tasks lining up to the prod push with end-to-end testing in a CICD form and hence deliver \nthe product to business.I started by performing a deep dive to learn the project’s requirements \nand  establish  a  set  of  tenets.  Following  which,  I  finished  up  my  ramp  up  tasks  and  performed \n\n126 \n \ndeep  dive  on  the  technologies  involved  and  began  working  on  a  delivery  plan  for  the  project. \nThen,  I  documented the  appropriate frameworks  and  compared them.  After  organizing  a  team \nreview, I applied the given feedback and choose Katal framework for the UI. Moving to the next \nphase, I performed a deep dive into Katal and AWS CDK. Once confident enough, I created the \nrequired  packages  and pipeline  for  hosting the UI  in  AWS  CloudFront. I  extended  the  pipeline \nuntil the prod stage simultaneously working on the actual UI. I raised CR with 96% unit testing \ncoverage and presented a demo for the same to the team. As for the AWS integration, I again \nperformed  a  deep  dive  and  documented  all  the  suitable  approaches  and  organized  a  team \nreview.  Based  off  of  team  feedback  and  factors  such  as  security  and  ease  of  integration,  I \nchoose  the  most  suitable  approach  and  implemented  it.  The  next  major  goal  was  beta  stage, \ntherefore I started with the most important tasks required for beta testing including setting up a \nNova domain and added custom CloudFront template with CR, migrated the cloud infrastructure \nto CDK package with CR, integration testing of UI with CR, making changes to backend for API \nrequests with CR, then I performed manual beta testing and the PVT in prod is ongoing. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): I have definitely improved my skills in the domain \nof code quality, version control, languages and document writing.

The first was related to automation of alarms related to my team's \nservice.  The  existing  process  of  manually  creating  and  updating  alarms  is  not  scalable  and  is \ntedious  to  do  for  large  sets  of  alarms.  I  automated  this  using  Live  Pipeline  Templates,  a  tool \nused  to  programmatically  create  pipeline,  Apollo  stages,  alarms  and  dashboards.  For  my \nsecond  project,  I  had  to  accommodate  a  list  of  holidays  within  the  exception  dates  attribute \nwithin  customer  delivery  profile.  The  previous  functionality  allowed  customers  to  opt  out  of \ndelivery  on  federal  holidays  each  of  which  could  be  associated  with  only  one  date.  I  extended \nthis to include a list of holidays, such as in Diwali or Eid. For my final project, I had to include a \nlocker accessibility option as an additional address attribute. In certain specific locations in the \nUS, lockers had been introduced so that packages could be safely delivered when a customer \nwas not at home. I had to include an option for the customer to opt for delivery to a lower locker \n\n129 \n \nslot. This feature will be helpful for differently abled people to collect their parcels. I also worked \non  a  few  minor  projects  such  as  introducing  a  latency  metric  for  the  current  location  feature \nowned   by   my   team,   and   fixing   an   out   of   date   version   set   with   the   correct   package \ndependencies. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java, Junit, JavaScript, AUI test framework, Live \nPipeline Templates, Ruby. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: 1.  Automate  alarms  for  my  team's  service  using  Ruby.  2. \nAccommodate  a  list  of  holidays  within  the  exception  dates  address  attribute.  3.  Introduce  an \naccessibility feature within the existing customer delivery profile, for locker delivery to opt for a \nlower slot. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: I learnt about the importance of having metrics to monitor the health \nof  a  service,  so  that  the  team  is  appropriately  notified  in  time  and  they  can  prevent  a  major \nservice  failure.  I  studied  about  various  metrics  such  as availability,  latency,  host  class  metrics \netc,  while  implementing  the  automated  alarms  for  them.  I  got  a  good  understanding  of  Spring \nMVC  in  Java  and  the  Junit  test  framework.

EDAMS  is  responsible  for \nvarious  services  related  to  devices  present  in  fulfillment  centres  across  the  globe.  These \nservices  can  be  provisioning,  managing  deployments,  monitoring,  health-check  etc.  Edams \nmake it easier to deploy lambdas to end devices and manage and monitor these deployments in \na  seamless  manner.  The  deployment  manager  part  involves  development  of  various  backend \nAPIs for implementing this service which includes APIs to start deployment, handle failures, get \ncurrent deployment status and information, perform single-device and group deployments etc. It \nalso  involves  handling  the  permissions  and  security  as  this  shall  only  be  used  inside  Amazon \n\n133 \n \nFulfillment Centres.

Personal Skills - developing documents, writing reports, communication etc. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: Not applicable since this was a development project. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Amazon  is  a \nvery firm believer of the first day principle where it encourages everyone to maintain the same \nenthusiasm  and  commitment  towards  work  daily  as  one  would  show  on  his/  her  first  day  at \nwork.  Also  Amazon  also  keeps  their  leadership  principles  in high  regards  and  the  interns  and \nemployees  likewise  are  expected  to  abide  by  them  and  use  them  in  their  day  to  day  task. \nThere's lots of different teams at Amazon therefore the work one gets differs from team to team. \nIn general one gets to learn new stuff and also get to learn about AWS (Amazon Web Services) \nsince  almost  everything,  every  project  or  service  uses  AWS  in  some  form  or  other.  One  also \n\n134 \n \ngets  to  learn  how  to  code  at  an  industry  level  since  there  is  a  strict  code  review  process. \nComing to work environment, it is not as chill as other companies and there is a heavy workload \nat  Amazon.  While  it  is  team  independent,  in  general  the  amount  of  work  one  has  to  do  at \nAmazon  is  far greater  than  other  PS  stations.  Also  the  conversion  process  is quite  strict since \nthey are continuously monitoring and taking feedback throughout the internship and there's bar \nraiser meetings and all at the end before the final decision. The teammates are friendly and they \nwill help you with your tasks, however they only refer to resources and you have to learn mostly \non your own. And the learning curve at Amazon is quite steep as there are lots of internal tools \none needs to learn. Overall, if one is looking for good learning opportunities then Amazon is a \ngood place however one needs to be ready to work for more hours and give more effort. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Software  Development,  Data  Structures  and \nAlgorithms,   Object   Oriented-Programming,    Database    Systems,    Network    Programming, \nOperating Systems, Computer Networks."

Now, that system was being deprecated and \nneeded  to  be  replaced  with  a  new  system.  My  project  was  to  build  a  new configuration \nmanagement system for my team. The idea was to use native AWS technology, which would be \nsupported for  a  longer  duration  of  time  such  that  the  system  has  a  long  lifetime.  The  project's \nscope  included  work  estimation,  coding,  testing, and  code  deployment. The  aim  was  to give  a \nbuild a fully functional configuration management service within the duration of the internship. \nSince a new service was needed, I first had to setup the pipeline and create new packages for \nthe  code.  Then,  I  learnt  the  various  AWS  (Amazon  Web  Services)  technologies  that  were \nneeded as part of the project like Lambda, AppConfig, CDK, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB and \nmore. After a basic design approach was set, I started writing code, one API at a time, building it \nend to end along with the integration test files. The main code was contained in AWS Lambda \n\n135 \n \nfunctions(which  activate  and  run  the  code  based  on  a  trigger)  and  I  spent  most  of  my  time \nwriting  them  using  relevant  Java  software  development kits.  The  testing  was  mostly  on  AWS \nAPI  Gateway  to  verify  the  output for the  different  operations. I  used  AWS  CDK  to  build  all  the \ncloud  infrastructure  needed  for  my  service.  This  was  really  useful  as  now  the  service \ninfrastructure could easily be replicated to different AWS accounts and even be rendered out as \na template to allow easy building of infrastructure. Towards the end, I spent most of my time on \ncode  reviews.  Once  the  code  reviews  were  done,  the  project  was  completed  and  pushed  to \nproduction.  Finally,  I  needed  to  create  good  documentation  for  future  reference.

Regular   meetings,   one-on-ones,   and  stand-ups   with  my   mentor, \nmanager, and other team members were enriching and helped me be a better professional. As \nan add-on, I got the opportunity to learn many new and modern technologies, which will help me \nin  my  future  projects.  I  learnt  a  lot  of  AWS  technologies.

These need to abide by a set of regulations set by global \n\n140 \n \ngoverning  bodies. To  check  their  compliance,  every  creative  needs to go  through  a \"checklist\" \nand a human reviewer answers each question, which can be quite dull and arduous. \nMy task during this internship, was to build a tool where this process can become easier. So, \n1.  I  first  added  some  new functionalities  to  the  VC  (Version  Control)  tool  that  helps  reviewers \ncompare different versions of a creative. \n2.  I  wrote  code  for  Comment-Interpretation,  so  as  to  automatically  check  if  the  previously \nmarked corrections have been made. \n3. I built the platform for automated MCR.

The \nregistration of a drug product in the emerging markets and the ROW markets is being done to \nmake  the  drugs  available.  But  here  comes  the  challenge, where  the  drugs  that  has  been \nregistered  is  not  available  in  the  market  on  the  date  that  is  mentioned  by  the  regulatory \nauthority. This phenomenon is called as drug lag and this mostly occurs after the registration of \ndrug  in  a  particular  market  and  then its  non-availability.  This  project  focuses  on  the  factors \nmainly responsible for this lag, its reasons (manufacturer lag, application lag, regulatory lag and \nthe drug lag thesis) and different regulatory strategies that can be used to minimize the drug lag, \nalong  with  the  non-regulatory  strategies.  The  method  that  has  been  opted  here  is  review  of \nseveral regulatory information from websites of regulatory agency and past experience from the \norganization.

Diabetes  results  in  rise  in  blood  glucose \nlevels  caused  by  defects  in  insulin  action,  secretion,  or  both.  This  rise  in  blood  glucose  levels \nresults in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are major cause for \nthe   development   of   diabetic   complications   like   diabetic   retinopathy,   neuropathy   and \ncardiomyopathy. There are speculations about diabetes being a generational disease based on \nsome pedigree  studies,  meaning  that  diabetes  in  parents  can  have  effects  on  successive \ngeneration individuals. But till date, there are no detailed studies which covers this aspect. Thus, \nthrough  this  study,  we  address  if  high  glucose  stress  given  to  parental  generation  can  have \neffects  on  subsequent  two  generations  in  terms  of their  AGEs  levels.

The objective was to forecast dividends to be given by the \nS&P  500  companies  in  the  next  one  year,  so  as  to  determine  fair  value  of  futures,  which  the \ntraders can quote in the market, and generate profits. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : 1. Basics of working and treatment of an index. 2. Different index \ntrading  strategies.  3.  Methodologies  of  various  indices  and  strategies  based  on  treatment  of \ncorporate actions. 4. Analysis of dividends. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  working \nenvironment was very friendly, quite informal and motivating, which for me was one of the best \nparts  about  this  internship.  Each  member  of  the  team was  an  amazing  mentor  as  well  as  a \n\n130 \n \nfriend. The company expects you to climb the initially steep learning curve quickly and then to \nbe able to suggest and carry out tasks independently. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project : Business  Analysis  and  Valuation,  Financial \nEngineering"

Later,  I  wrote  a  custom  lint  rule  for  a  pattern  not  picked  up  by  any \nexisting rules. It was pretty cool, since I had to identify the pattern by traversing the AST. These \nexercises  also  helped  me  understand  React,  the  codebase  and  frontend  development  in \ngeneral. After  that,  I  had  to  refactor  an  existing  component,  which  happened  to  be  the  main \nfeature on the website's second most visited page. It was a notoriously buggy component and \nthe code was a mess. The refactoring was tricky - since it  was a relatively  long-term project, I \nhad  to  incorporate  new  features  requests  concurrently.  I  reduced  code  complexity,  response \ntime  and  memory  footprint  across  the  board.  I  also  made  it  more  reliant  on  W3C  specs  and \nbehaviours,  so  it  allowed  for  minimal  effort  when  adding  support  for  other  browsers.  For  good \nmeasure,   I   then   refactored   the   most   visited   page   too. I   also   worked   on   styling   the \ndocumentation site for the product. It was managed by a third party service, so I was basically \nhacking  my  way  around  their  default  styling  and  behaviours  through  pure  CSS  and  HTML \nscripts - bare-metal  frontend  development  if  you  will.

The  company  has  these  weekly  learning  sessions,  where \nsomeone  would  present  a  new  technology  (not  necessarily  being used  by  the  company) and \nthen we could discuss it.

Primary project was “Representation of Wiring Harness on Abaqus”. Had to simulate the \nbehaviour  of  a  cable  under  different  types  of  loads  in  Abaqus  as  a  1-dimensional  FEA  model \nusing beam elements. \n \n\n466 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Got to work on Abaqus, Hypermesh, Hyperview, \nANSA, MetaPost, NX Flexpipe andPython. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: FEA  solvers  have  become powerful  and  can  run  simulation  on \ndesign with high complexity. However, such simulations are computationally expensive and time \nconsuming. Additionally, there can only exist finite computational resources. To make the most \nof it, it would be efficient to reduce the complexity of design by representing bulky components \nwith  their  simplified  versions.  This  project  aims  to  create  a  reduced  1-D  model  for  a  wiring \nharness cable using beam elements to be used as simplified model in larger assemblies, while \ncapturing the material behaviour accurately. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Learnt some industry leading software used by the CAE experts in \nthe team. The amount of exposure I received while working with the team is invaluable. Got to \nlearn  some  good  professional  ethics.  This  internship  has  helped  me  improve  upon  not  only \ntechnical skills, but also my interpersonal skills. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: MBRDI is the \nperfect  place if  you  love  automobiles,  and  are interested  in research that  goes  into  making  a \nbrand a customer’s preferred choice.

I \nwas   part   of   this   project   responsible   for   analyzing   and   implementing   new   risk   model \nmethodologies, automating existing reporting, load sharing over daily risk analysis and modeling \ntasks throughout the transition. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): RiskFactor  Engine,  kdb+/Q,  Python,  R,  STATA, \nMS Office. \n \nObjectives of the project: Corporate Credit Risk Model Optimization. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: - Risk  models:  This  was  my  first  experience  in  the  field  of \nquantitative risk management and I learnt great deal about different kinds of risk management \nmethodologies. \n- Programming for finance:  Languages  like kdb+/q  and  STATA  apart from  Python  and  R  were \nused which are becoming widely used in the financial industry. \n- Corporate culture: Being one of the top investmentbBanks of the world, Morgan Stanley gave \nample opportunities to interact with several international stakeholders from different parts of the \norganization and even learnt often ignored details like what sets apart a good mail from a great \none in a professional environment. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Morgan \nStanley  gives  a  unique  blend  of  independent  learning  and  deliverable-oriented  culture  where \n\n497 \n \neveryone  is  given  sufficient  freedom  to  explore,  learn  and  contribute  way  beyond  their \nstructured project plan. The timings  are friendly  (most  teams  log  in  after  12PM)  and  even  in  a \nvirtual  environment,  the  onboarding  was  seamless.

They are capable of regenerating any missing body part in process \nrequiring   stem   cell   (neoblast)and  positional   information.  The   planarians  acquire  variable \nstructural  properties  and  gene  expression  profiles  during  regeneration.    Many  genes  are \ninvolved in the wound healing, pattern recognition, Cell proliferation, Organ/tissue regeneration \nand  morphallaxis.  Knockdown  study of  various  genes  uncovered  the  essential  genes  for \nregeneration, RNAs are isolated from whole organism by trizol method, and subjected to cDNA \nsynthesis.  The  cDNA  is  later  used  for  T7  Primer/Specific  gene  amplification  in  order  to \nsynthesize dsRNA which shall be used for RNAi study. The gene under study is involved in the \nhead and muscle regeneration and whose knockdown would lead to serious perturbations in the \nregeneration of planaria.

The  registration  workflow  was  also  in  a \nsimilar  state  earlier  but  was  refactored  recently,  the  same  was  done  for  un-registration  in  this \nproject.  \n\n535 \n \n1) A task-based framework has been added over the un-registration workflow - We create one \nparent task which tracks the progress of several child tasks .Currently in the un-registration flow, \nthere  are  several  small  sub  processes,  we  make  a  child  task  for  each  of  these  sub-\nprocesses.As  the  child  tasks get  completed,  we  move  forward  the  progress  of  parent Task.  In \ncase any of the child task fails, the parent task automatically fails. Only if all the child tasks get \nsuccessfully completed, we mark the parent task as completed. \n2) Cleanup, which was earlier performed using a Python script, now has been added as a part \nof  un-registration  workflow - For  migrating  these  clean-up  scripts,  I  had  to  understand  how  to \nconstruct  complex  IDF  queries  inside  the  prism  gateway  codebase. In  order  to  successfully \nimplement  these  I  coordinated  with  the  IDF  team  and  got  their  review  as  well  after  successful \nimplementation. \n3)  An  annotation  based  method  of  declaring  pre-checks  and  cleanups - This  solution  involves \ncreating two custom annotations, one for pre-check and one for clean-up. Any team can declare \ntheir pre-check and clean-up functions in their own class with these annotations. The annotation \nprocessor will automatically add these to the un-registration workflow. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Maven - Apache Maven is a software project and \ndependency management tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven \ncan  manage  a  project's  build,  the  version  of  dependencies  to  be  used  and  several  other \nproperties in a central manner.  \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  refactor  the  un-registration \nworkflow  and  get rid  of the flaws  associated  with  it.  Some  of refactoring changes: 1.  Adding a \ntask based framework 2. Adding Zookeeper check to avoid race condition 3. Writing a custom \nannotation processor and generator. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I learnt how  to  use  Nutanix  tools  and  libraries  to  quickly  and \nefficiently   create,  manage  new   packages   and   services.Creating   detailed   and  descriptive \ndocumentation was another key learning I had. The design docs helped me to understand how \nto  analyse  a  problem  and  its  requirements,  come  up  with  multiple  solutions,  identify  their \nassumptions,  pros  and  cons,  etc.Some  of  the  frameworks  and  libraries  I  learnt  as  part  of  this \nproject are spring boot, Rest, JUnit, Java Poet, etc. I also learnt how to  write proper unit tests \nthat  cover  all  possibilities  and  scenarios.I  learnt  the  importance  of  proper  logging  through  this \ninternship. All the bug tickets that were assigned to me in this internship had the log files. Ability \n\n536 \n \nto  read  and  search  the  logs  in  an  efficient  manner  was  one  of  my  key  learnings.

The \nprimary  focus  of  our  work  was  to  develop novel  approach  to  handle  virtual  machine  live \nmigrations. One of the major problems in VM live migration is memory dirtying. Dirtying refers to \nthe modification of any memory page owned by the VM. Frequently dirtied memory needs to be \ntransferred  repeatedly  over  the  entire  duration  of  migration.  As  a  result,  when  the  memory \ndirtying  rate  is  high  and  network  bandwidth  is  limited,  migration  may  not  converge.  Throttling \nVMs to reduce vCPU execution time is the current approach in QEMU to handle such cases of \n\n537 \n \nhigh memory dirtying. Existing throttling algorithms throttle all the vCPUs of a VM, penalise read \nand  write  processes  across  all  vCPUs  equally.  We developed new  dirty  quota  based throttling \nalgorithm  that  selectively  throttles  vCPUs  based  on  their  individual  contribution  to  overall \nmemory  dirtying  and  also  dynamically  adapts  the  throttle  based  on  the  available  network \nbandwidth. Our approach drastically reduced migration times and also enabled the convergence \nof migrations in P99 and P99.9 cases which was not possible before. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): C, Vim, Git, Crash, kprobe. \n \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Devise  a  vCPU,  aware  VM  live  migration  algorithm  that  enables \nfaster convergence of live migrations. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Strengthened  my  OS  and  memory  management  concepts,  learnt \nvirtualisation  from  scratch, good  understanding  of  KVM  and  QEMU  codebases,  gained  Linux \nkernel development and debugging experience.  \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: I  found  the \nworking environment at the company was very good.

Initially all spans were colored using correlation id and graph id.   \n? Now all kernels with same name are colored with same color and also we have single color for \nall memcpy and memset. \n? Also  categorized  Run-time  and  Driver  based  APIs  into  different  types  and  assigned  a  color \nbased on the type to which they belong. \nWhy to update the coloring scheme? \n? Correlation Id is a sequentially incrementing number given to each CUDA API executed in a \nprocess. \n? The  coloring  did  not  give  any significant  information  apart  from  just  separating  adjacent \nactivities. \nShow GPU ranges for NVTX for easy correlation to kernel. \n• Initially our tool used to show NVTX ranges of CPU. \n• Using  list  of  correlation  ids  corresponding  to  run  time  apis  and  driver  apis, I  found \ncorresponding start and end times with respect to GPU by using map between those apis and \nkernels. \n\n413 \n \n• Now it can show both GPU and CPU ranges for NVTX. \nWhy do we need NVTX GPU ranges? \n• Highlight  feature  was  used  to  correlate  the  NVTX  CPU  range  to  corresponding  kernels  and \nmemcpy launched on GPU. \n• The  issue  was  that  CPU  range  can  be  far  apart  from  the  GPU  activities  to  see  in  the  same \nview. \n• Converting  CPU  ranges  to  GPU  range  enables  easy  correlation  of  NVTX  ranges  with  GPU \nactivities. \n   \nString table optimizations \nInitially, the tooltips for all spans were having lot of information which was using lot of memory. \nNow, these  spans  data  would  be  stored  into  array  of  structures  which  would  be  decoded  in \njavascript plugin which would be assigned according to type of span.  \nEncoding part is done in utility which is in native c++ code these structures are exported to java \nscript  plugin  which  would  decode  each  field  of  information  into  respective  span  field  hence \nreducing the memory usage. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Visual studio code. \n \nObjectives of the project: Updating coloring schemes for spans, Show GPU ranges for nvtx for \neasy correlation to kernel, string table optimizations. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: C, C++, JavaScript, Data structures and algorithms. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company: Work \nenvironment was very good.

These tests are written to verify the different functionalities of the context switching \nunit and the various safety features implemented to make it industry functional safety standard \ncompliant. A bug / error is caught when running regressions of such tests on the main unit (DUT \n– Device  under Test),  in  our  case  the  Context  switch  unit.  There  were  many  types  of  debugs \nthat were  performed.  In  many  cases  the  error  was  found  to  be  in  the  tests  (test  not  correctly \nanticipating  the  behavior  of  the  DUT  under  certain  conditions).  In  numerous  cases, the  debug \nprocess resulted in corrections in the design of the microcode. Sometimes, a bug may also be \nfound  at  the  RTL  code  level  in  which  case  appropriate  changes  need  to  be  made  in  the  RTL \ncode. The  extensive  debugging  process  also  lead  to  more  and  more  clarity  of  the  unit  and  its \nbasic  functionalities.  Continuous  study  of  the  internal  architecture  and  verification  specification \ndocuments in parallel aided the learning process. \nOther  than  debugging  tasks,  many  coverage  tasks  were  also  completed.  As  per  requirements \nfor functional  safety,  its  important that  our testbench  covers  all  the sections  of  the  DUT,  i.e  all \npossible scenarios are hit. This ensures every line of the DUT code is hit at-least once to ensure \nthere  are  NO  blind  spots  in  the  DUT  design.  The  same  testcases  written  for  functional \nverification can also be modified to include scenarios to hit boundary cases that may not get HIT \nin  the  normal  course  of  the  GPU / unit’s operation. Separate directed test sequences were \ncreated  to  hit  corner  cases.  A  cumulative  report  gets  generated  in  the  end  which  gives  a \ncomprehensive evaluation of line as well as conditional code coverage. It marks the section of \nDUT code which were not hit by the tests. In which case, a further analysis needs to be done, \nas to why / what lead to this. And an appropriate stimulus or a checker needs to be added to Hit \nthe missed cases. Many times, a MISS may occur due to some corner case inside a loop which \nnever  gets  hit.  Such  cases  are  solved  by  implementing  a  checker  in  test  to  hit  that  case  by \nspecifically sending a particular argument to that code snippet. \nFinally, a lot of experience was gained while  working upon these tasks while at the same time \nenjoying it due to the detective like nature of the work. Finding out bugs, solving them and at the \nsame time meet deadlines to contribute to the team working towards a common goal was very \nexciting as well as enlightening. \n \n\n416 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Verdi wave viewer, Perforce version management \nsystem, NVBUGS bug tracking system. \n \nObjectives of the project: To achieve functional safety compliance of the context switching unit \nof Nvidia GPUs for automotive applications. \n \nMajor   learning outcomes: Functional   verification   and   testing   methodology.

The  technology  allows  for simultaneous access to services  on \nthe mobile network. But there is a disadvantage to it that for minimizing hardware consumption \nwe have only one trans-receiver for both the sim. As a result, whenever the network (EnodeB) \nallocates the resources to a dual sim phone some of the resources go as  waste because at a \ntime we have only one sim active.

So, in this task, \nthe initial calculations comprises of calculation of no. of RE’S acquired by LTE channels (csrs, \nsss, pss, pbch) and no. of RE’s acquired by SSB (combination of sss, pss  and  pbch)  and \nCoreset 0 (Pdcch 0) in 5G NR. So as a final result, it is proved that SSB and Coreset 0 played a \ncrucial role in 5G NR, as in this less RE (resources) were acquired by them compared to more \nRE acquired by LTE channels. The major reason was CSRS was not here in NR due to which \nthe saved RE’s were utilized  for  data  instead  of physical  layer  channels, which  indirectly  gave \nrise to more throughput (data rate) in NR and less bandwidth wastage as compared to LTE. As \nan  add  on    some  simulations  of  LTE  modules  was  done  on  NS3  software,  from  which  the \nresultant plots like  path loss effect v/s increasing distance of UE (user) from enB, sinr  effect v/s \nincreasing distance of UE (user) from enB were observed. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): LTE downlink resource element visualization tool, \nmatlab, Ns3 software. \n \nObjectives of the project: ESTIMATION OF OVERHEAD DUE TO REFERENCE SIGNALS IN \nLTE & NR BASED NETWORKS. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understood overhead due to Reference signals resource elements \n(REs) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) networks. At physial layer, reference / \npilot signals are used for control, signaling and synchronization tasks accurately computing the \noverhead REs is necessary to achieve an efficient system design. The current study is aimed at \nexploring  the  influence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  downlink  performance.  Current  work  modelled \nall  overheads  for  synchronization,  controlling  and signaling  operations  in  LTE/NR  physical \ndownlink  shared / control channels.  This  allows  for  dynamically  computing  the  useful  REs  (by \nsubtracting  the  overhead  REs  from  the  total  ones),  both  per  Transmission  Time  Interval  (TTI) \nand  per  frame  (and  hence,  the  corresponding  bit  rates).  Our  data  rate-based  performance \nmodel is able to accurately compute the real, exact system data rate or “throughput” (instead of \napproximations). Aiming at understanding the impact of each overhead mechanism, carried out \na  variety  of  simulations and  the  simulation  results  prove  our  starting  hypothesis  that  the \ninfluence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  performance  should  not  be  neglected.  Finally, the  model \nquantifies  to  what  extent  throughput  gets  improved  in  NR  systems  over  LTE  with  reduced \noverhead REs. \n\n529 \n \nDetails of papers / patents: NA. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nculture  was  amazing with  all  talented, enthusiastic  and  passionate  people  around  me.

I  also  enhanced  the  Gardener  Resource  Manager(a \ncomponent  that  keeps  reconciling  and  keeps  the  cluster  in  its desired  state)  to  include  an \nannotation from  the  metrics  server.  I also  started  working  on  HVPA(Horizontal  Vertical  Pod \nAutoscaler).While the learning experience has been great, I was given the opportunity to  work \non very important projects that are integrated with the new Gardener release. This motivated me \nto give it my best effort. \n \n\n684 \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Docker, Kubernetes, Gardener  Dev  Landscape, \nGardener  Local  Setup, VPA, Metrics  Server, Addon  Resizer, Gardener  Resource  Manager, \nVisual Studio Code, GitHub. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Improve  and  enhance  autoscaling  across  Gardener. Enhance  the \nVPA  exporter  to  read  and  export  annotations  from  the  new  recommender.  Calculate  and \ntabulate ETCD downtime to enable development of the ETCD Scale metrics server without VPA \nto remove circular dependency, and enhance the GRM Add webhooks and enhance HVPA v2. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I  learnt Docker,  Kubernetes  and  Gardener, VPA,  HVPA,  Metrics \nserver,  API  server,  Custom  controllers  and  CRDs.  I collaborated  with  different  teams  and  this \nwas great learning too. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: No patents or papers were involved. The enhancements I made are \nmerged with the Gardener product. Some of them will be a part of the next release. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  work \nenvironment is very nice, and there are no hard deadlines. The team is very helpful and friendly. \nIt is better if the student opting for PS at SAP is open to PPO, as they look at the internship as a \nlearning experience for their full time employees. And they offer PPOs to most interns. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Advanced  Operating  Systems and many  online \ncourses were relevant and useful."

It  consists  of  Processor,  Optical  modules,  Control \nFPGA, timing device and other peripherals like power module and memories. Schematic is first \ndrawn where we connect all the components. The layout of the board is made and sent for PCB \nmanufacturing.  Then  a  cold-test  is  performed  on  the  finished  board  after  which  it  is  hardware \ndebugged  and  various  signals  are  checked  by  probing  those  signals.  This  task  is  called  the \nboard  bring-up  and  is  a  very  critical  task  for  checking  the  proper  functioning  of  the  board,  the \nvarious  signal  levels  and  the  proper  working  of different  protocols.  My  work  involved  mainly  in \nthe  schematic  design  and  design  review  along  with  the  board  bring  up  of  another  card.

After  a  certain  amount  of  water  absorption,  the  delamination  of  a  layer  from  the  glass \n(PMMA) substrate occurs leading to the formation of a white patch. The current study proposes \na method to avoid the condensation of water vapor by reducing its concentration in the cluster, \nwith  the  help  of  proper  air  circulation  using  air  vents  placed  at  different  heights  on  the  lower \nsurface  of  the  instrument  cluster.

It takes  a  2V  DC  input  and \ngenerates  a  regulated  output  of  8V  DC.  The  charge  pump  is  supported  by  a  clock  signal  of  a \nperiod  of  40ns.  There  are essentially  three  functional  blocks  in  a  charge  pump  system, clock-\ngenerator circuit, charge pump and a comparator. The comparator block consists of a two-stage \nOTA. Since, in a comparator design, high gain is very essential, therefore, the two-stage OTA is \ndesigned.  Opamp  compensation  is  carried  out  to  make  sure  the  closed  loop  configuration  is \nstable.  It  also  leads  to  good  settling  characteristics.  Two  most  popular  approaches  are \ndominant-pole compensation and lead compensation. In the four-phase clock generator circuit, \nfour clock signals are generated, out of which two are overlapping signals and the other two are \nnon-overlapping   signals.  The   overlapping   signals   are  the   inverted   versions  of   the   non-\noverlapping  ones.  Charge  pump  is  a  kind  of  DC–DC  converter  that  consists  capacitors  and  a \nswitch  network  controlled  by  some  clock  signals  only.  A  high  potential,  either  positive  or \nnegative, can be generated by the charge sharing actions among different capacitors during two \nor more  clock  phases.  Conventionally,  this  kind  of  circuits  was  implemented  using  diode-\nconnected NMOS switch network.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Cadence virtuoso and Finesim. \n\n605 \n \nObjectives of the project: • The significance of a charge pump system in memory circuits. \n• The working of a charge pump system and its functional blocks. \n• Understanding the process of designing circuits to achieve stability of a complex system. \n \nMajor learning  outcomes: • Understanding  various  concepts  of  analog  integrated circuit \ndesign. \n• Designing  stable  analog circuits  like,  two-stage  OTA,  clock-generator  circuit,  charge  pump, \netc. across all process corners. \n• Learning basic level scripting to access files from various directories. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Western Digital \n(SANDISK)  sets  out  to  achieve  its  goals  in  ethical,  honest  ways  with  an  elevated  sense  of \npurpose.

Special  tools  compile  the \nhardware device delays into these speedfiles/timing files. These files are critical, and any error \n\n784 \n \nin these files can cause problems to the end-user. To catch these errors at an early stage, the \nfollowing checks were implemented:  \nCoverage check: To ensure timing data/arcs are present for all modelled cells. \nCompleteness check: To ensure timing data/arcs are complete for all modelled cells. \nCorrectness check: To check the validity of timing data. This check is dependent on the type of \nfile being checked.  \nSynchronicity  check:  To  check  synchronicity  of  timing  data  across  all  families/ devices  for  a \ngiven architecture. \nThese checks were then run as regressions, a process of running a series of tests every day to \nverify  the  correctness  of  the  software  in  response  to  data  updates  and  tool  changes.  For  this, \nrdi,  an  internal  framework  developed  by  Xilinx,  was  used.  The  tests  were  submitted  to  a  load \nsharing facility (LSF), where all these tests were run parallelly to save time and other resources. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Linux, Python, TCL, Bash. \n \nObjectives of the project: Create software checks that can be run as regressions to check the \nspeedfiles(internally generated files) based on specific criteria. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I got  an  opportunity to  interface  with  the  Linux  environment.  I  also \nlearnt to use data structures, regex and other modules in Python. Other than that, I learnt TCL \nand Bash. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The work was \nentirely  online  on  a  virtual  desktop  infrastructure (VDI).  We  had  our  own  working  spaces  and \nLinux directories where we could run codes locally before checking them into common directory. \nWe  majorly  worked  in  Python,  TCL  and  Bash.  We  did  not  really  have  any  training;  rather  we \ndirectly worked on small scale projects and leant along the way. The team members were really \nhelpful  and  were  ready  to  help  us  whenever  required.  After  a  few  weeks,  we  were  able  to  do \nmost of the implementation ourselves. We had weekly team meetings and daily meetings with \nour mentors, and we were expected to give an update in all meetings. The tests we developed \nwere  implemented  on  a  central  framework,  and  because  of  this,  we  even  got  a  chance  to \ninteract with teams in the USA and Ireland.  \n\n785 \n \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOPS, DSA, FPGA Lab."

Due  to  various  updates,  these  applications \nare now to be used for an even wider user base, thus requiring a large increase in the scale of \nthe deployments.

It would also be highly time consuming to \nhost  them  on  the  bare  metal  servers  where  all  of  the  updation  and  management  is  done \nmanually.

Before  verifying  any processor \narchitecture,  a  verification  engineer  should  have  every  test  scenario  getting generated.  This  is \ncalled  Coverage  Collection.  The  coverage  reports  are  generated  every  week.  The  coverage \nreport of two consecutive weeks are compared to know which all test cases are missing in one \nof the report and not in other report or the test cases missing in both the reports. Since this is \ndone  every  week,  it  can  be  automated. Test  case  generator  gave  required  number  of  test \ncases.   Then, coverage   was   collected   using   Coverage   Collector.

The  employee  just  type  in  query  as  an \ninput and the bot pulls data from the production databases or appropriate portal and reply back \nto the user. The data is pulled in two ways, through direct connection to database and through \nRestful API. The Bot takes natural language input from the user, cleans the input and searches \nkeywords  from  it,  the  keywords  or  entities  are  collected  and  sent  to  the  routing  engine.  The \nrouting engine then tries to identify the intent of the user. When found, it routes the flow to the \nintended functionality with the entities as inputs. The specific function processes the entities and \nreturns the desired result, which is then pushed to the bot space. The Bot is made proactive in \nnature,  so  if  multiple  failures/Errors  happens,  the  bot  gives  a  notification  to  the  required  bot \nspace.  It  also  provides  a  link  in  description  where  the  problem  can  be  handled  from.  The  Bot \nalso  checks  changes/delta  in  logs,  if  any,  is  immediately  pushed  to  space.

                "writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Cisco  provides  multiple  solutions  in  order  to \nmanage  Firepower  Threat  Devices  (FTDs).  These  solutions  vary  in  terms  of scalability  and \noffering  of  various  features.  Firepower  Device  Manager  (FDM)  is  a  single-device  on-box \nmanagement  solution  that  manages  FTDs.  Firepower  Management  Centre  (FMC)  is  the \nadministrative  nerve  centre  for  managing  critical  Cisco  network  security solutions.  It  provides \ncomplete and unified management over firewalls, application control, intrusion prevention, URL \nfiltering, and advanced malware protection. Team can view details about customer video mesh \ndeployments.  Typically,  medium  and  large-scale customers  exceed  the  limit  of  number  of \ndevices managed by a single FMC or FDM instance. Hence, there is a need to migrate policies \nfrom one FMC to another or from one FDM to FMC. As part of this project, the idea is to develop \na robust framework that is capable of inputting different configuration data sources to FMC and \nachieve a data driven model converter. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Golang, Visual Studio Code, Github, Postman. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  project  consists  of  3  different  use  cases,  out  of  which  I  am \ninvolved with the 3rd use case, that is, Data Migration from FDM to FMC of the Data Migration \nService Development. The problem statement of the project is as follows: FDM and FMC both \nare  managers  for  FTD.  FDM  is  installed by  default  on  the  device  and  it  can  manage  just  that \ndevice.  FMC  can  manage  up  to  800 FTDs.  Every  time  a  customer  buys  an  FTD,  he  needs  to \n\n228 \n \nconfigure  an  FDM  to  manage  that  device.  Also,  the  FDM  provides  limited  features  while  the \nFMC  provides  multiple  features.  So,  the  same  FTD  is  managed  by  multiple  managers.  If  an \nFMC is provisioned for the customer, he will be liberated from managing multiple FDMs. All the \nFTDs  can  be  configured  and  managed  by  one  FMC  until  it  reaches  its  full  capacity,  when \nanother FMC  will be provisioned for the customer. So, the objective is to migrate configuration \nfrom Single-Device on-box manager (FDM) to Multi-Device Manager (FMC). \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understanding the architecture and working of FMC and FDM, the \nvarious object configurations, software designing in industry, practical exposure to REST APIs, \nGo programming language, working with visual studio code, Git, REST APIs using Postman. \n \nDetails  of  papers/patents: A  survey  on  the  role  of  Internet  of  Things  for  adopting and \npromoting.

As  the  second line  of  defense  for  the  bank’s  risk  and  compliance \nframework, my work involves looking at incidents within the bank at a global level arising due to \nthe above-mentioned risks and reporting the financial impacts along with remediation to the BoD \nand regulatory bodies periodically. I am also currently working on the bank’s annual quantitative \nrisk  appetite  recalibration  that  involves  cleansing  historical  data,  structuring  them  to  entities \nassociated and creating dashboards that will aid in re-calibrating the entity risk appetite levels. \nIn  addition,  building  controls  within  the  team to  validate  data  quality  using  Visual  Basic  and \ndocumenting them as Standard Operating Procedures was another key project that I have been \na part of.I was also involved in automating the data segregation and classification processes in \nVisual Basic and designed dashboard reports that will be sent to over 30 legal entities and all 07 \ndivisions  within  the  bank.

In  my  case  I  got  to \nwork with NetWorker product of EMC to take backup, perform restore etc. The KT sessions on \nNetWorker were helpful to get a brief understanding of NetWorker's operation. Dell handed over \nNetWorker development to HCL as part of transition. For the next project, I was part of SDNG \nteam  and  worked  with  DDSD  API. I  worked with senior  engineer  on  logging  functionality  for \n\n285 \n \nDDSD API and came up with macros/inline functions to replace conditional ENTRY/EXIT traces \nfor  logging.  To  successfully  complete  this  task  also  required  separating  the  APIs  according  to \ntheir functionality(backup/restore) and understanding the C code base for these APIs and relate \nwith  the  flow.

Account creation/updation/deletion services have been added. \nListing resources of the GCP account and allowing for on-demand snapshots was done. Audit of \naccount  related  activities  was  also  added to  show  what  tasks  were  done  and  their  respective \nstatus (completed/error/in-progress etc). \nDesign - As  AWS  and  Azure  platforms  are  already  supported,  help  was  taken  from  these \nservices, control  and  data  flow,  UI  design,  front  end user  input  checks  and generating  correct \napi-uri parameters were done. \nTesting - The newly generated UI for GCP and dashboard have been tested for various screen \nsizes,   browsers   (Chrome,   Mozilla   and   IE).   Validations   for   user   input   on   account \ncreation/updating  have  been  done.  Responses  from  various  api  calls  to  the  server  have  been \ntested to ensure correct information is displayed on UI. \nImprovement  in  productivity and  efficiency - As  new  preact  Javascript  library  have  been  used \nreplacing the older angular code, many api calls are reduced. Earlier many HTML, JS, CSS files \nwere  requested  from  server  for  a  single  view  but  Preact  has  reduced  the  number  of  these \nrequests  to  1  for  each.  This  reduced  the  load  time,  memory  usage  and  network  bandwidth \nrequirement to a minimum.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): IDE - VScode \nLanguage - TypeScript \nBrowser - Chrome, Mozilla, IE \n \n\n289 \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Adding  Google  Cloud  Platform  (GCP)  support  for  Cloud  Snapshot \nManager  and  refactoring  the  dashboard to  use  new  Preact  based  components  replacing  older \nversion in angular. \nMajor learning outcomes: Worked on code -  \n1.  Production  ready  code  is  highly  modular  in  design  and  structure.  This  is  required  for  good \nreadability  and  modifiability  of  code  in  future.  Team  members  working  on  the  same  code  can \neasily understand the purpose and internal functioning of snippets.  \n2. For UI,  the HTML elements are wrapped inside custom components which makes it easy for \nre-use and modification to suit the context.  \n3.  The  JS  version  used  (typescript) is  open-source  making  it easy  to  use.  There  is  a  strict \nimposition of data structure on the objects used thus ensuring that only correct data formats are \nused. \n4. The application brings under its control almost all possible use cases to make sure none of \nthe conditions are unhandled when application is in use by the customer. \n5.  Comments  are  extremely  important  to  help  understand  input/expected  output  of  code \nsnippets. Applications usually  live for 10-12 years which requires proper transfer of knowledge \nfrom current to future team members.  \n6.  Coding  conventions  developed  should  be  strictly  followed.  This  make  it  easy  for  other \nmembers to understand the semantics of variable names and function prototypes. Terminology \nrelated to product is easily understood making development faster and testing easier. \nWorked as a team member - \n1.  Ask  for  help  and  be  ready  to  help  any  time.  Mistakes  are  unavoidable  but  learning  and \nimprovement are most important. \n2. Time management is very important. Delaying work can cause problems as time might not be \navailable later. \n3. Conceptual understand of project is required before we start coding.  \n4. Keeping the data safe is very important. Many times machines failed during the development \nand data was lost. Commiting any work done to remote repository is important. \n5. Taking breaks from work can lead to relaxed mind and increases productivity. This also helps \nto come up with solutions to problems. \n6.  Look  for  solutions  on  internet.  Ask  team  members  and  proceed.  Also  remember,  they  are \nalso busy. Respect each ones time and work. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n\n290 \n \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Organization of \nTeam - Two distinct groups of people for - Front End, Back End. \nInitially, a small assignment was given to bring familiarity with the tools used for the project. This \nhelped me to understand what is expected of the project on a bigger scale.Teams were highly \nengaged with each other as in scrum process. Free flow of ideas among all members including \nthe   higher  management   concerned  with  the  project.  Weekly   meetings   ensured   work   is \nprogressing in desired direction with good amount of work done. Challenges when encountered \nwere resolved with help from members. Some were simple but some took around a weeks time \nto  get  resolved.  Manager  understood  the  challenges  as  we  are  working  from  home  and  its \ndifficult  to  get  other  person  immediately  online.  Sufficient  time  was  given  to  understand  the \nproject.  They  were  considerate  enough  to  change the  schedule  for  demo  of  project  when  I \nrequired some  other  urgent  work.The  technical  lead  was  very  helpful  and  open  for  any  doubt \nsession. Sometimes he even showed me the line number and function name that needs to be \ncalled. At other times, he would give me time to study the code and understand the concept and \ntools used on my own.   \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Research Practice - extremely helpful. \nNetworking - making api calls to remote hosts."

This plan and \nactivities are all part of our Marketing drive 2021. \n1) Research and Advisory Organizations - Through firsthand research, I came up with a list of \nsuch  organizations,  this  is  part  of  the  analyst  mapping  part.  Next, I  started  working  on \nengagement. \n2) Ethnographic research - storytelling -   Stories are a universal language of sorts. I have done \nthe  background  research,  first  understanding  what  is  ethnography  and  ethnographic  research. \nThen developing a meticulous report of ethnographers in urban governance ecosystem. \n3)  Influencer  marketing - Influencers  are  the  one to  create  and  share  original  content  that \nresonates  well  with  our  brand  and  their  audience.  Influencers  can  help  signal  to  people  in  the \naudience that our work is important or interesting from a resource they already trust.  \n4) Media Outreach – Publications - Media outreach gives us the chance to pitch our content to \npeople/media outlets who have a platform to share it with a wider audience. It has no limitations \nand  might  revolve  around  the  press,  social  media  networks,  and  popular  blogs  around  the \nworld. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): My  project  was  more  about  researching  and \nengagement. No specific software was used in my project. Only to analyze the reach of  website \na few organizations - I used a software named Similarweb. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: To  spread  brand  awareness,  increase  brand  value,  make  e-Gov \nstand out in our ecosystem and increase reach such that we are talked about more and more in \nthe ecosystem. \n\n309 \n \nMajor  learning outcomes: I learnt  a  lot  about  non-profit  sector,  urban  governance,  17 \nsustainable  development  goals  by  the  UN  which  are  to  be  achieved  by  2030  and  various \ncompanies and its social divisions  working towards it. I got to know the nuances of marketing, \nGTM and partnerships and how important it is for an organization. How to convert your several \nmonths  long  research  into  conceptualized  themes  for  engagement  for  individual  organizations \nand moreover, how to build strategic relations within and outside the organization. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: Not applicable.  \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Working \nenvironment - Even  in  the  online  mode,  the  response  of  my  teammates  was  very  heartening, \nthey feel you connected.

After  getting  a  basic  understanding  of  pricing  algorithms,  I  chose  a \nbusiness  case  to  work  on  i.e.  'Consumers  end  up  paying  more  due  to  high-frequency  pricing \nalgorithms.'  So,  the  goal  that  I  tried  to  achieve  here  was  to  develop  a  pricing  tool  for  the \nretailer/target  firm  to  monitor  weekly  prices  and  volume  for  everyday  grocery  items.  Through \nthis, they can select the algorithm that gives the 'maximum revenue' for their particular business \nstrategy, while also keeping 'consumer's interest' at hand. \nI chose 2 food items – ‘yogurt’ and ‘salsa’ and 1 beverage – ‘beer’ as our products for which we \nmade  weekly  price  recommendations,  estimated  the  weekly  demand,  and  calculated  the \ncorresponding  revenue  generated.The  algorithms  that  were  used  in  the  simulating  product \nprices were 'Thompson Sampling', 'Q-Learning' (Reinforcement learning techniques), and 'Joint \ndistribution-KDE' in python.Finally, I made a pricing tool on 'Power BI' for the retailer/target firm \nwhich helps them monitor Actual v/s Predicted (prices, volume, and revenue). \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Microsoft  Excel,  Python,  Jupyter-lab,  Spyder, \nMachine learning, Reinforcement learning, Power BI. \n \nObjectives of the project: Provide some improved gross revenue margin to the retailer/target \nfirm  on  everyday  grocery  items  like  yogurt,  salsa,  and  beer  through  the  use  of  pricing \nalgorithms, while creating a good consumer experience. \n \n\n323 \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Experience of working in a professional environment. \nImportance of effective communication, teamwork and efficient planning. \nApplication of technical concepts to live problems. \nI learnt how to own the task and work independently. \nHow meetings happen and deadlines are set. \nI got a chance to improve my interpersonal skills. \nI learnt Microsoft Excel, Python and ML,RL for data analysis and model building. \nI learnt Power BI for building reports, dashboards & interactive tools for data visualization. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: A White-Paper on 'Algorithmic Pricing in Retail Industry'. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Mostly,  the \nwork  was  focused  on  New  Product Development - creating  a  dynamic  pricing  tool  that \ncompared  certain  algorithms  and  implements  the  best  one  in  that  business  case  scenario.For \nthe  initial  stages,  some  amount  of  research  is  required  to  understand  the  existing  literature \naround the project and thus, develop a unique solution solving the chosen business case. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: It  is  good  to  have  knowledge  of  Principles  of \nEconomics, Supply Chain Management, Machine Learning.

The  work required \nbuilding  and  developing  the  entire  algorithm  for working  of  the  entire  project  from  scratch.  I \nworked  on  deep  learning  NLP  based  models for  semantic  similarity.  The  entire  codebase  was \ndeveloped   in   python.

Generally,  three  types  of  vibration  occur  on \ngoods  while  transportation (i.e.) lateral,  longitudinal,  vertical  vibration.  At  lower  frequency \nvertical vibration are significant as compared to lateral & longitudinal but at higher frequency all \nthree of them are equidistant.

The  training  program  concludes  with final  assignment  which  requires \ninterns to work in teams of 3 to build website based on the requirements provided. \nAfter the training, I had the opportunity to work on 2 POCs - first on a Kickdrum customer project \nand  the  other  for  mobile  app  development  using  Flutter.  I  worked  on  few  AWS  S3  file  backup \nscripts  for  another  project  as  well. Finally,  I  was  involved  in  migrating JIRA  project  from  one \ncloud instance to another with management team. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): AWS, React, HTML, CSS, Flutter, Node JS, Java \nSpring, UiPath automation. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  first  project  required  our  team  to  provide  a  POC  for  UiPath \nautomation testing tool. The tool had to be evaluated to be utilized by  Kickdrum customers for \nvalidating their complex airline scheduling interface. For the second project, we had to develop \na  template  mobile  application  interface  using  Flutter  framework, Dart  and  provide  detailed \nanalysis of the performance and limitations of the same. As a small, short duration requirement I \nwas involved in working on NodeJS scripts to create a real-time backup of AWS S3 instances. \nFinally,  I  was  involved  in  migrating JIRA  project  from  Kickdrums  instance  to  one  of  their \ncustomers. This required rigorous research into project management and custom data stored in \nprojects. Migrating the project is a non-trivial task as of now since JIRA does not provide single \nproject migration feature. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Most of the technologies I had an opportunity to work on was a new \nexperience for me. The Kickdrum version control standards and software engineering practices \nprovide a really good foundation to build upon. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The Kickdrum \nteam  is  extremely  supportive  to  their  interns.  Every  member  is  always  available  to  help and \nguide interns at a moments notice. Kickdrum expects genuine effort and a learning attitude as \nthey believe in providing and receiving constructive feedback. \n\n435 \n \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Data  Structures  and  Algorithms,  Object Oriented \nProgramming, Software Engineering."

The model will identify checkboxes from a checklist and will classify the checkboxes in the \nchecklist  into  the  aforementioned  two  categories.  The  first  step  of  the  project  was  to  create  a \nbasic  model.  The  program  will  be  given  a  sample  input  in  the  form of  training  data.  The  data \ncontain two different directories of images. The next step of the process is increasing the size of \nthe  dataset  from  a  sample  size  of  200  images  to  a  size  of  4000  images.  Then  we  use  mlflow \nand integrate the model with it so that it can give a proper view of our parameters and results \nand help us in analyzing the results so that we can get the most accurate results after finetuning \nits parameters.

APIs  and  SDKs  make  it  easier  for  the \ndevelopers  to  incorporate  any  third  party  libraries.  Programmer  is  saved  from  the  hassle  of \ncreating  an  API  herself.  But  even  though  creating  an  application  is  important,  knowing  the \nproduct  from inside  is  important  too.  A  developer  must  first  understand  the  features  and \nbehavior  of  the  application  before  starting  development.  For  this, there  is  no  better  place  than \nthe testing lab where bugs and errors are reported in every software development life cycle. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): S/w:  Python,  kivy  2.0.0,  postman,  PWA,  Apace \ncamel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. \nH/w: Hardware Head unit device for testing feasibility. \n \nObjectives of  the  project: To  understand  the  overall  software  development  process  of \ninfotainment head unit system embedded in four vehicles.

During the start of my \nproject, I learned about Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Mesh. In order \nto maintain the low power consumption of BLE, Bluetooth mesh introduced friend feature. Then, \nI read about friend feature at transport layer in \"Mesh Profile\" Bluetooth Specification v1.0.1. For \nlow  power  nodes  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which  receive  data  less  frequently, \nthe  amount  of  time  that  they  need  to  listen  is  limited  by  establishing  friendship  between  low \npower   nodes   and   friend   nodes.   Did   literature   survey   on   how   to   compute   the   energy \nconsumption  and  lifetime  of  low  power  nodes  in  Bluetooth  mesh  network.  The  functionality  of \nnodes  with  low  power  feature  and friend feature is  developed  at  the  transport  layer. The  timer \nfunctionality is developed to maintain the timers for low power node and friend node. The timer \nfunctionality  is  integrated  with  the  low  power  feature  and  friend  feature  functionality.  Normal \nBluetooth mesh node functionality is implemented in the transport layer in addition to low power \nand friend feature functionalities.  In this project, the average current consumption and lifetime \nof  Bluetooth  mesh  low  power  node  is  computed.  Also,  the  average  time  statistics  of  different \nBluetooth mesh nodes are compared, and it is observed that, low power node is in sleep state \nfor most of the time which results in more lifetime of the low power node.  \n\n250 \n \nOther Activities: Improved coding skills in MATLAB by doing Cody. Improved company needed \nskills by frequent interactions with the manager and mentor. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : S/w: MATLAB \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : Develop  friend  functionality  to  conserve  the  energy  of  Bluetooth \nmesh  low  power  node  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which receive  data  less \nfrequently.  The  energy  is  conserved  by  limiting  the  amount  of  time  that  the  low  power  nodes \nneed  to  listen. This  can be  achieved  by  establishing friendship  between  low  power  nodes  and \nfriend nodes. Once friendship is established, friend node stores messages that are addressed to \nthe  low  power  node  and  are  delivered  to  the  low  power  node  when  it  explicitly  requests  the \nfriend node. Also, friend node relays messages on behalf of low power node. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learned  new  concept called  Bluetooth  mesh  introduced  in \nBluetooth  5.0.  Learned  how  to  design  friend  functionality  and  its  timers  using  OOPS  in \nMATLAB. Learned about unit testing by testing the friend functionality at the transport layer and \nintegration  testing  by  testing  the friend  functionality  after  integration  with  other  layers  of  mesh \nsystem architecture. Learned about how devices are simulated in real-time. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment is peaceful and enthusiastic.

The \nfiles  analytics  team  was  creating  an  AWS-based  version  of  their  existing utility.  My  work  was \ndivided  into  sub-tasks  to  facilitate  this  movement.  In  the  first  part,  I  worked  on  creating  the \ninfrastructure on the cloud database platform which would store the incoming data and process \nit.  The  process  involved  using  the  functions and  features  provided  by  the  cloud  database \nmanagement system to mirror the tasks done on the on-premises database. The next part dealt \nwith creating a password rotation manager Lambda on AWS to manage the credentials for this \ncloud database. Another subtask dealt with creating the infrastructure to facilitate the sending of \nransomware  notifications  to  the  user  based  on  certain  events.

In  my  first  project,  I  was  in  a  team  and  our  objective  was  to \nautomatically verify the personal information given by the supplier and customer is right or not. \nFor this, we had to make an API to call the government website and take information from there. \nTo  do  so  we  had  to  bypass  a  captcha.  To  break  the  captcha  we  made  a  machine  learning \nmodel to do so. \nThe second one was to make a part of a web application to automatically make a graph of the \ncompany’s transaction to map the connectivity between  companies.  Since  oxyzo(a  subsidiary \ncompany  of  OfBusiness)  is  an  SME  financing  platform.  So,  to  give  loans  to  a  company  our \nprocessing team has to run a background check on the bank transaction of the company. This is \na tedious process and requires a lot of time. So, to move this faster my project was to make this \ngraph of the companies that are our customer or have a history of a certain type from that bank \ntransactions. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w) : Spring  Mvc,  java,  neo4j,  react,  echarts,  python, \nkeras \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : To make  a  network of  companies to to make  the  loan processing \neasier \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : There were a lot of things that I learnt from working in OfBusiness. \nIt  includes  software  development,  how  to  work in  a  team,  how  to  manage  my  time  in  a  better \nway and lot other little things. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  working \nenvironment  of  the  company  was  very  friendly  and  supportive.

Also  sometimes, new  services  are  needed  that  we  need  to  develop  from \nscratch as no libraries are available or the tools are paid that get job done. So basically, I wrote \ncrawling code for 20-25 websites, as well as developed helper tools like HTMLtoPDF converter \nfor  conversions  of  HTML  to  properly  formatted  PDF's,  also  wrote  various  REST  api's  for \n\n588 \n \ndifferent  task's  required.Attended  workshops  on  new  technologies  and  improving  overall \ntechnical skills. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java 8, REDIS, S3,MongoDB. \n \nObjectives of the project: Contribute to the SPIDER project by writing crawling code of various \nwebsites, as well as improvements to the crawler and adding utilities and services. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: All this in-turn greatly improved my understanding of REST services \nand HTTP request, concurrent programming, use of producer and consumer, design patterns in \npractice, various deep learning concepts . \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NIL \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The crawler is \nmost important to the organisation as it produces the required data, that is used by other teams \nlike  back-end,front-end,  to  maintain  their  websites, design  required  services  and provide  them \nalso, the contribution to the SPIDER project should  boost the productivity of the other teams, as \nwell  as  increase  the  amount  of  CORRECT  data  available  to  them,so  code  written  should  be \nsuch that full fill these tasks, so the PR's that we submit are rigorously tested, and attention to \ndetails  are  given,  so  as  to  not  Ingest  incorrect  data.

NOC  have  an  advantage  of  meeting  the  needs  like \nscalability, physical routing feasibility at the same time they don’t compromise on the speed. \nArchitectures today implement different open standard AMBA protocols as they help seamlessly \nintegrating peripherals from different vendors with the proprietary systems. To avoid re-spins in \nthe  design, VLSI  design  flow  demands  a  step  known  as  design  verification.  Design  cycle  of  a \nsemiconductor  chip  involves  thoroughly  verifying  its  functionality.  My  work  at  Qualcomm \n\n492 \n \ninvolved verifying the bus architectures of mobile system processors. To thoroughly verify all the \nfunctionality,  functional  coverage  in  enabled  wherein  we  create  different  test  scenarios  and \nprovide  different  stimulus  to  ensure  that  all  the  functionalities  are  covered  and  verified.  This \nprocess  help  in  catching  RTL  bugs  at  very  early  stage. Another  design  verification  metric  is \ntoggle  coverage  which  is  done  at  the  final  stage  of  the  design  cycle.  Toggle  coverage \nenablement  helps  in  catching  bugs  due  to  data  corruption  and  ports  being  tied  to  incorrect \nvalues which may not be caught during the functional verification. Another task included writing \nassertions  and  developing  checkers  to  verify  different  features  in  NOC.  Assertions  remain \nclosely tied to the RTL and continuously keep monitoring the design functionality even when the \nmain focus of simulation has shifted from the design functionality. So, design verification plays \nan important role in avoiding chip re-spins and reduces NRE. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Synopsys  Verdi,  Systemverilog,  UVM,  Assertion \nbased verification. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Finding  and  reporting  RTL  bugs,  thoroughly  exercising  different \nstimulus combination to verify different functionality. \n \nMajor  learning outcomes: Functional  verification  at  SOC  level,  ARM  bus  protocols  and \nverification tools and technology. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Expectation:  \nThe organization expects students to have knowledge in HDL and HVL languages. Knowledge \nof UVM can be of additional help since all the test bench used in industry in developed in UVM. \nKnowledge  of  C  language  is  also  a  fundamental  requirement.  The  organization  expects \nstudents to develop debugging skills as they work through the project.  \nWorking  Environment:  The  working  environment  at  Qualcomm  is  quite  positive  and  lively. \nThough tight project schedules demand long working hours there is lot of fun events like team \noutings,  games,  etc.  which  happen.

Mainly  these  kind  of  scenarios  require  modifications.  Sensor  connectivity  and \nchaining was also the part of the work done in the course of this internship. This is done based \non   the   feedback   received   from   cores,   physical   design   teams   and   sensor team’s \nrecommendation. Sensors are required to be placed on the SOC to capture several parameters \nsuch  as  temperature, voltage,  process  variations, etc.  My  role  was  to  get  acquainted  with  all \nthese works and take up small tasks in the team and apply these into the live project. \n \n\n638 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Company Confidential Information. \n \nObjectives of the project: Power intent design and verification. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Power domain related information, Sensor connectivity. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: None \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Great working \nenvironement.

A  firmware  code  had  to  be \nwritten for deciding the values of the clock dividers used. A pseudo-code for this algorithm was \nwritten,  which  was  then  used  as  reference  for  writing  firmware  code.  The  main  challenges \nencountered were the tradeoffs like area and the time taken. We had come up with atleast 6-7 \ndifferent  approaches  from  our  discussions  to  try  to  solve  the  problem.  However,  some \napproaches did not work out or were creating more problems. Every failure was a learning and \nan  encouragement  to  come  up  with  a  better  solution.  I had  many  discussions  with  my  team \nmembers,  and  these  discussions  gave  rise  to  many  ideas.

Oftentimes,  I was also tasked with creating these Google dashboards to track a host of \nmetrics (such as total trips taken, trips per rider, gross bookings, number of promotion trip taken, \netc.)  for  new  market  regions  or  new  payment  partners.  I  also  had  the  chance  to  assist  with \nnumerous  ad-hoc  analyses  and  one-time  data  pulls  which  basically  required  me  to  query  out \nsome  data  from  the  database,  import  it  into  Google  sheets  and  then  use  sheets  formulae  to \ncondense that raw data into useful/readable metrics which were then organised and presented \nin  a  final  view.  Another  type  of  work  that  I  was  tasked  with  was  doing  BAU  (or  Business  as \nUsual) tasks, the most common of which involved updating existing dashboards with the latest \nweekly and monthly data at the start of a new week or month. In most cases, when a new query \nneeded  to  be  written,  I was  usually  provided  with  an  existing  query  that  retrieved  similar  data, \nand would just edit that query as per my own needs and requirements. As such, writing queries \nfrom absolute scratch was quite uncommon. \n \n\n736 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): There was a wide range of tools that I used over \nthe  course  of  my  work  at  Uber,  however  most  of  those  tools  were  internal  tools,  exclusive  to \nUber such as Querybuilder, so I had to learn how to use them from the ground. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: As  there  was  no  single  \"project\"  that  I  was  assigned,  most  of the \nwork I did involved assisting more senior analysts with their work, or completing tasks that I was \ndirectly assigned by managers/team leads. So, some of the \"objectives\" of the numerous tasks \nand  projects  I  worked  on  included:  setting  up  new  dashboards;  performing  post-promotional \ncampaign data analyses to quantify how well a promotion performed; cleaning up and updating \nan onboarding document that is shared with all new Uber joinees; and automating queries used \nby large projects to eliminate the need to manually run them, amongst other things. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: The major learning outcomes I gained were:  \n- Writing and optimisation of SQL queries. \n-Creation, updation and maintenance of Dashboards on Google Sheets \n- Usage of Google sheets formulae to process raw data into readable/useful metrics. \n- Automation of queries through the use of the internal uWorc tool. \n- Creation of custom database tables with the Kirby internal tool. \n-Cross-team communication when working on large multi-team projects. \n- Time-management/organisational skills, required to keep up the flow of continuous tasks and \nprojects. \n- Ability to quickly identify and find necessary database tables through the Databook internal tool \n- Communication  skills,  required  when  presenting  the results  of  your  work  to  the  associated \nstakeholders. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment at Uber is a very dynamic and fast-paced one where you will recieve new work and \ntasks on daily basis. Despite this, your team members and other analysts are very friendly and \nsupportive and will be happy to help you out. Due to the organisations emphasis on \"ownership\" \nof work, you will not only have to finish the work/tasks assigned to you, but will also be expected \nto maintain and update any and all dashboards, documents and queries you create during your \ntime  at  Uber.  Also,  even  though  you  will  have  a  mentor  and  be  part  of  a  larger  team,  most \n\n737 \n \nanalysts work on their tasks alone, and usually only reach out to others for help/assistance. The \nsame  is  true  of  interns  and  you  will  most  likely  be  the  only  one  working  on  a  specific \ntask/project.  In  terms  of  work  deadlines,  they  aren't  very  strict,  and  you'll  usually  just  have  to \nfinish  your  work  as  soon  as  possible,  or  within  the  stipulated  time  that  your  stakeholder \nmentions. You will also have a lot of freedom to meet and interact with people from other teams, \nas oftentimes, the most well-qualified person to resolve your doubts may not be from your own \nteam. Furthermore, since everyone in the organisation uses either Google Hangouts or Slack, it \nisn't difficult to communicate with others, despite the limitations of WFH. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Unfortunately,   due   to   my   background   in \nMechanical  Engineering,  none  of  the  academic  courses  I  had  completed  were  relevant  to  the \nwork and projects I contributed to at Uber."
