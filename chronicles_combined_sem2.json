				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : Modelling of a chemical process is an imperative \nstep  for  reaching  a  quality  target.  Currently  modelling  is  being  done  by  extracting  online  data, \nfollowed by modelling of this offline data. The developed model is then applied on the process. \nThus,  it  would  be  efficient  if  modelling  would  be  done  online.  Regression  techniques that  are \nused for online estimation and control generally yield poor models if the data is not rich enough. \nIn this report a modified block-wise dynamic recursive PLS technique that is based on selection \nof  rich  data  has  been  studied  for  online  adaptation and  control.  Because  of  its  ability  to \naccommodate a wider range of forgetting factors, the technique is found to track the dynamics \nof slow as well as fast changes in the processes. The reviewed algorithm has been studied with \nrespect to the carbon black process. In an effort to self-tune the carbon black process, a deeper \nunderstanding of the reviewed technique has been done by reviewing the basic techniques such \nas  Principle  component  analysis,  partial  least  square  technique  and  recursive  partial  least \nsquare  technique  along  with  an  in-depth  review  of  the  carbon  black  process  itself.  The \nmethodology  towards  achieving  the  goal  of  self-tuning  has  also  been  proposed  along  with  a \nfuture vision to attain more clarity. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : matlab, ms office, origin \n \nObjectives of the project : • To understand Regression and its different types   • To  understand \ndata analysis • To study different self tuning methods and their algorithm • To    analyze    Matlab \ncodes for previously developed tuning methods • To  develop  a  Matlab  code for  self  tuning of \ncarbon black process (mainly reactor) • To  model  the  real  time  plant  dataset  using  Partial \nLeast square Regression and  Modified Partial Least square Regression . • To compare \ntheir predictive capability. \n \n\n37 \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : • The  modification  made  in  the  forgetting  factor  calculation \ngives better results. \n• Month by month addition of new datasets allows us to view change in model adaptation. \n• From the given graphs it can be concluded that  Modified Block-wise Recursive PLS is \nbetter at model adaptation as compared to Partial Least Square Regression because: \no Model adaptation is faster \no Error from the actual values is smaller. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company :  \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Process Modelling"

The  entire  data \nrelated to these products are stored in Master Data Management (MDM). So different distributer \nand retailers have their own data base where they can record details of products but MDM as a \nmaster maintains the data of each product with a unique code to each product, MDM acts as a \nsingle source of truth by standardizing the data and incorporated rules in order to find incorrect \ndata, new rules are made with some logics and algorithms to find the incorrect data and helps to \nidentify  the  products  with  issues,  these  products  with  issues  should  be  cleaned  by  Data \nGovernance Team (DGT), along with cleaning process DGT also works on Mapping, Levelling, \nQuality Checks etc. The data in MDM should be validated by some professionals so as a part of \nDRX-Doctor’s  Program  doctors  are  hired  to  validate  required  data  in  MDM.

I  have  gained  new \nknowledge,  skills  and  met  many  new  people.  I  achieved  several  of  my  learning  goals.  I  got \ninsight  into  professional  practice.  I  learned  the  different  facts  of  working  within  a  construction \ncompany.  I  experienced  that  proper  planning,  management  and  execution,  as  in  many \norganizations, is an important factor for the progress of projects. Related to my study I learned \nmore  about  the  Designing  and  construction  of  all  types  of  pavements  and  materials.  I  have \n\n71 \n \nwitnessed   various  construction   activities  and  have  got   better   understanding   of   practical \nknowledge.  I  understand  the  concept  of  use  of  WMM  as  crack  relief  layer  to  avoid  reflection \ncracking from CTSB and CTB. Since it is coastal area provision of CTB and CTSB as GSB layer \nis followed by the guidelines.

To  accomplish  this,  we \ndescribe a novel “semantic infusion” method, which infuses special marker strings in the word \nvector space of the text, in order to locate these trending terms. We also demonstrate the power \nof  our  method  by  comparing  its  results  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  with  those  of  a  well-\nestablished  algorithm,  the  Online  Processing  Variant  of  LDA.  We  outline  a  few  industrial \napplications for our method which were tested so far. We then shift our focus to a different area \nof interest at Bosch: prediction of product recall incidents from complaints data of automobiles. \nIn  this  task,  we  focus  on  developing  a  usable  dataset,  using  a  set  of  rules  applied  to  existing \ncomplaint and recall data. We build a deep neural network classifier, pass this dataset to it, and \naim to predict if a complaint against an automobile will result in its recall or not. We provide our \nresults and a short analysis of our observations from it. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Python, Keras library, Word2Vec \n \nObjectives of the project : 1) Develop an automated method of extracting the trends from the \ncorpus by introducing the concept of semantic trends.  2)  Compare semantic trend results with \nthe results of a well-established trend analysis algorithm, Online Processing Variant of LDA, to \nestablish  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  improvement  of  the  semantic  infusion  technique.  3) \nDevelop  a  classifier, specifically  a  bidirectional  Long  Short-Term  Memory  to  identify  whether  a \ncomplaint is severe enough to warrant a recall of the product.  4) Prepare a dataset which can \nbe directly used by the classifier, and observe how the predictive power of the model changes \nwhen it is trained with data from different time window sizes. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : 1)  Performing  experiments  to  test  the  quality  of  results  from  an \nalgorithm.  \n2) Documenting the complete project into a paper for a conference. \n3) Preparing a dataset from existing resources to supply to a classifier.  \n4) Building a deep learning model to classify text. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : Submitted a paper to CIKM 2019. \n \n\n81 \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment  was  relaxed.

The  objective  of  the \ncurrent study was twofold (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient between finger and glass substrate using the strain gauge-based sensor. The role of \ndifferent  parameters  such  as  stroke  frequency,  Uni  vs  bi-directional  stroke, static  friction  was \nstudied. Protocol parameters were recommended to better differentiate the systems with smaller \ndifference  in  COF.    (2)  the  second  part  of  the  work  focuses  on  the  impact  of  different  factors \nsuch  as  surfactant  types,  pH,  alkalinity,  viscosity,  ionic  strengths  and  skin  hydration  on  the \nfriction  coefficient.  Ionic  and  nonionic  surfactants  were  chosen  for  the  study,  namely:  (a) \nAnionic:  NaLAS,  SDS,  SLES,  MES,  SLI,  (b)  Cationic:  CPC,  CTAB,  (c)  Zwitterionic:  CAPB  and \n(d) Non-ionic: EO7 and Lutensol XL 60. Non-ionic surfactant showed higher frictional coefficient. \nAmong  the  anionic  surfactants,  the  COF  trends  were  SDS<Na-LAS<  MES=SLES<SLI.  The \ntrend  was  explained  using  the  CMC  and  packing  parameter  of  surfactants  at  the  air/water \ninterface.  Cationic  and  anionic  surfactants  of  comparable  CMC  showed  similar  COF.  pH \nexperiments showed COF was primarily governed by the reserved alkalinity of the system and \nnot the pH. E.g., for same pH, sodium carbonate gave lower COF than sodium hydroxide. Skin \nhydration  shows  a  maximum  in  COF.  Viscosity  decreased  the  COF  which  was  in  line  with  the \n\n189 \n \nlearning  from  Stribeck  curve  that  the  viscosity  increase  shifts  the  lubrication  regime  from \nboundary to hydrodynamic regime. \n \nTool   used   (Development   tools - H/w,   S/w) : Strain  gauge  load  cell   based   sensors, \nfluorescence spectrometer, dynamic surface tensiometer, python and Matlab codes for analysis \n \nObjectives of the project : (1) to establish a reliable and robust protocol to measure the friction \ncoefficient  between  finger and  glass  substrate  using  the  strain  gauge-based  sensor.

Learnt  a  lot  :)  On  the  other  hand,  I  also \nattempted  to  help  my  manager  to  make  a  design  template  (a  training  catalog)    for  the \ncorporation, like what they have to offer to the aspiring interns, for learning about the needs of \nthe company (specifically for the PIDC). \n \n\n199 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Company had provided us with Laptops and very \ngood access to the internet connectivity. \n \nObjectives of the project : To learn about the various syndicated offerings of US-based as well \nas India-based market research companies under IQVIA space. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learnt  how  to  identify  white  spaces  and  gaps,  i.e.  where  a \ncompany  misses  out  on,  which  offerings  are  they  lacking,  that  other  companies  (competitors) \nare serving their customers (clients) with. Basically to identify strengths and weaknesses. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Overall  the \nexperience  that  I  had  was  good.  Met  a  bunch  of  great  people.  :)  Although  I  struggled  to  learn \nabout  the  needs  of  the  company  in  the  beginning  of  the  training,  I  have  learnt  quite  a  good \namount :) by constantly doing research. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project : To  be  honest,  there  were  not  any  Academic \nCourses that I took in my early semesters that actually matched the project that I did. A totally \ndifferent research and learning (outside my academic curriculum)"

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : The products considered for study are 14 SEER, \n2-5  tonne  packaged  heat  pump  models.  These  models  are  used  for  both  heating  and  cooling \napplications.  Micro-channel  Heat  Exchanger(MCHX)  is  used  in  the  indoor  side  of  these  units. \nMCHX  is  either  used  as  an  evaporator  or  an  condenser  depending whether  the  heat  pump \nsystem  is  in  cooling  or  heating  mode  respectively.  The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  increase  the \ncapacity  of  MCHX.  It  is  achieved  by  increasing  the  air  side  Heat  transfer  Coefficient.  Air  side \nheat  transfer  coefficient  can  be  increased  by adding  fins  or  creating  rough  surfaces.  In  this \nProject air side heat transfer is enhanced by adding surface roughness (in the form of grooves). \nA  small  part  of  MCHX  is  modelled  in  creo,  to  analyze  the  present  heat  transfer  and  pressure \ndrop in ANSYS Fluent. This modelled MCHX is imported into ANSYS Workbench and simulated \nin  ANSYS  Fluent  to  calculate  the  present  heat  transfer  and  pressure  drop.  From  the  solution \nreports  it  can  be  observed  that  because  of  grooves  there  is  improvement  in  heat  transfer \ncoefficient by 5% due to increase in effective surface area. The increase in pressure drop from \nplain-tube to grooved-1-tube was found to be 2.9% because of increased turbulence. But from \nplain-tube-surface  to  grooved-2-tube-surface  the  pressure  drop  increase  was  only  1.19% \nbecause grooved-2 profile was little rougher and had more surface area than grooved-1 profile. \nTherefore  Grooved-2-tube-surface  can  be  selected  for  optimum  heat  transfer  and  pressure \ndrop. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Creo, ANSYS Fluent \n \nObjectives of the project : Improvement in Performance of Micro-channel Heat Exchanger \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learnt  about  heat  exchangers,  Gained  practical  knowledge  on \nheat pump systems \n \nDetails of Papers/patents : -Nil \n \n\n204 \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company : Very Friendly \nmanagement, flexible working hours \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Heat Transfer, Refrigeration and air-conditioning"

The purpose of \ndoing synthesis is to convert the RTL code of module to technology dependent optimized netlist, \nit minimizes the slack to meet the timing performance and also, it minimizes area and leakage \npower.  In  this  project,  synthesis  of  a  module  has  been  performed  using  Synopsys  Design \nCompiler. After applying appropriate constraints on a module, slack has been minimized to 0ns \nfrom 1.586ns and leakage power has been minimized to 1.652μW. \nAlso,  the  other  part  of  work  includes  clock  domain  crossing  (CDC)  check  which  has  been \nperformed on chip top level using Questa CDC tool. The intention of performing CDC check on \nchip top level is to make sure that the data exchange between different clock domains is smooth \nand functionally  correct.

I was also involved in the creation of an Employee Recognition Portal which was for \nthe HR team. \nApart from the project PS-II also gives us industrial exposure. I learnt how coding standards are \nin an industrial environment. Modulation of the code is of utmost importance. This is because a \nmajor concern of the institutions is scalability of the code. The code should remain usable even \nafter  a  particular  person  is  off  the  project.  It  should  be  understandable  to  everyone.  Thus, \nvariable  names,  packages,  documentation  etc. need  to follow  certain  rules  as  specified  by  the \ncompany. \nIn an industrial environment, essional conduct is also of a lot of importance. PS-II gave me an \nexposure  to  this  area  as  well.  Addressing  your  colleagues  and  documenting  all  conversations \nvia emails is very important in a work environment. \n\n281 \n \nAs it was my first exposure to IT culture and this programme helped me in every possible way to \nmake transition from an all-academic environment to an industrial environment.

Any  typical  floor  was  divided  into  spans  of  11m  x  11m \nconsisting  of  primary  beams  and  secondary  beams  supported  on columns  at the  corners. The \nsection  of  primary  and  secondary  beams  were  designed  as  per  ArcelorMittal  ABC  Software \npackage  considering  the  composite  action  of  slab,  ensured  by  providing  one  row  of  shear \nconnectors welded to the beams. Connections were designed using OSDAG software package. \nFor  achieving  efficiency  and  economy  the  column  section  was  varied  along  the  height  of  the \nbuilding  by  decreasing the  thickness  of the  plate,  along  the  height  of  the  building.

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: During  my  PS2  at  Amazon  as  an  operations \nmanager,  I  did  two  major  projects.  First  was  to redesign  the  delivery  bags  used in  Amazon \nprime  now.  We  had  some  major  issues  with  the  current  design  such  as  bad  food  non-food \nsegregation  mechanism,  no  adequate  space  for  bar  code  labels,  dark  inner  color  of  the  bag, \nbag unable to stand upright i.e. be stable when kept in a trolley for picking order products etc. In \norder  to  solve  the  problems,  I  performed  a  cost  effectiveness  analysis  between  the  reusable \nbags  and  the  previously  used  brown  bags  as  a  result  of  which  reusable  bags  came  out  to  be \ncheaper.  I then  performed  one  on  one  interaction  with  various  on  field  employees  and  then \ncame up with solutions with the help of my manager. We introduced three pouches on the inner \nwalls  of  the  bag  (back,  left  and  right)  instead  of  the  previous  rigid  mid  partition.  We  also \ndedicated  spaces  for  bar  code  scanning  labels,  changed  the  inner  color  to  lime  yellow  for \nvisibility and gave a PVC cardboard support in the lower 25% of the bag to make it stand upright \ni.e. stable when kept in trolley for picking. I also improved the temperature sustainability of our \nchilled bags by providing better insulation and reducing the number of gel packs used. This also \nreduced the overall weight of the chilled bags. As my second project, I created a robust quality \nand  social  distancing audit  mechanism  for  Prime  now  that  helps  the  central  team  to  identify \nprocess  misses,  compliance  gaps  and  other  improvement  opportunities.  I  also  created  an \nautomated  tool  using  python  language  of  programming  (pandas  library)  to  automate  the  audit \nreport generation  process.  This  tool  reduced  the  time  required  for  report  generation  from  7-8 \nhours / week to 15-20 minutes / week. \n \n\n74 \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Jupyter  Notebook  (Python  and  Pandas),  Excel \nand other internal Amazon tools. \n \nObjectives of  the  project: The  objective  of  redesigning  reusable  bags  project  was  to  a \ncomprehensive analysis of cost difference of paper bags vs reusable bags and to identify gaps \nin  the  current  design  of  reusable  bags  and  come  up  with  a  better  design  to  resolve  all  these \nissues. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Negotiation  skills,  Excel,  Document  writing  in  Amazon,  Python \nlanguage of programming (Pandas library), Cost effectiveness analysis, Designing of products, \nAutomation of mechanical activities and Amazon's leadership principles. \n \nDetails  of  papers / patents: My  patent  for  the  bag  redesigning  project  consists  of  the \nintroduction of three pockets in the back, left and right inner sides of the bad instead of the mid \npartition, dedicated spaces for bar scanner labels, introduction of PVC cardboard at the bottom. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment in Amazon is great. Some of the key highlights from employees point of view are \nwork hours flexibility and dressing flexibility. Amazon corporate offices are greatly built and has \nsome great facilities for the employees. Other than this, the most unique part of Amazon's work \nculture is its 14 leadership principles defined by Jeff Bezos. It is fun to see how all Amazonians \nlive by these 14 principles on every action we perform. When it comes to the expectations from \nthe  company,  Amazon  expects  us  to  firstly  follow  these  14  leadership  principles  by  all  means \nand  then  perform  our  projects  efficiently.  Amazon  promises  to  be the  most  customer-centric \ncompany  ever  and  hence  we  start  with  our  customers,  with  customer  satisfaction  and  move \nbackwards. We in Amazon are a family and are consider each and every problem as our own. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Principles   of   managements,   Optimization, \nComputer programming, Object oriented programming and Technical report writing."

				"writeUp": "75 \n \nStudent Write-up \n \nShort summary of work done during PS-II: 1.Ideal building costing and sizing (FC)   \nCurrently,  we  have  fulfilment  centers  (FC)  which  support  the  customer  demand and  we  are \ncontinuously in the process of launching new FCs. The task is to find the size building which is \nmost  cost-efficient  for  the  2 h delivery  model.  We  have  updated  the  design  principles  that \ndetermine  the  right  building  sizes.  The  result  is  the  size  of  a  building  that  would  minimize  the \ncost per unit and at the same time be feasible to be launched in the city regions. This building \nplan  has  evolved  over  the  former  model,  identifying  all  the  involved  costs.  The  work  also \nfocuses on how the cost change with the size of the building. \n2.Rate  Model - Business  requirement  sheets  (BRS)  provide  detailed  information  about  all  the \ndesign aspects of a specific building. They take in outbound volume as input and provide all the \n4Ms / Manpower / Shelving  as  cube etc.  as  an  output.  The  current  sheets  are  static  and  only \nportray  the  requirements  of  an  FC  for  a  given  outbound  volume.  The  idea  is  to  develop  a \ndynamic rate model using excel that would give all the elements and cost structure to make the \nFCs, depending on the Output and productivity. \n3.Ideal  Building  Costing  and  Sizing  (LPC) - There  are  two  types  of  buildings  in  the  UFF \nbusiness- FC  and  Hub / Live  Processing  centers  (LPC).  Taking  cues  from  the  methodology \nadopted for FCs, we have extended the model to Hub/LPCs. They are storage centers that are \npresent one leg before the Fresh FCs.  They also act as the processing centers for perishables \n(atta,  ice  creams),  and  fresh  produce  (fruits  &  vegetables)  including  the  tasks  of  grading, \nscaling, etc.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MS Excel, Amazon LMM tool,  Amazon PlayBook. \n \nObjectives of the project: The project covered three major deliverable that - 1.To arrive at the \nright  sizing  of  buildings  and  then  perform  costing  and  topology  analysis  for  a) Fulfillment \nCenters   b)Hub / Live processing centers   (LPC)   2.To   design   a   rate   model   of   building \nspecifications. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Supply chain management, Project management, Labor modelling, \nCost analysis and Topology analysis. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Confidential to Amazon. \n\n76 \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: As a part of the \ncurriculum  at  BITS  Pilani,  I  had  a  delightful  experience  in  the form  of  Practice  school (PS2) at \nthe Amazon Operations, Bangalore. I worked in the non-tech profile as an Operations manager \nintern in the supply chain execution team. We underwent a 10 day training at warehouses, sort \ncenters and delivery centers of Amazon to understand the core fundamentals of the processes. \nAfter  this, I performed  the learning by doing,  to  get  on  ground  training  of  GSF  (Special \nFulfillment) training. This lasted for almost 3 weeks and got hands on experience of handling a \nshift.  People  at  Amazon  are  helpful  and  friendly.  They  would  always  help  us  approach the \nproblem  instead  of  giving  direct  solutions.  They  also  make  sure  to  understand  the  business \ncontext of things. I tried out things, made mistakes and learned in the process. Amazon has an \ninclusive  work  culture  as  the  people  are  welcoming.  Our  work  is  valued  and  interns  are \nconsidered as a part of the team like any other employee. All in all, Amazon makes a great work \nplace and is the place for people who aspire to create their future in Operations. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Production  planning  and  control,  Operations \nmanagement, Supply chain management."

So, \nafter this, a new proposal for the procurement of 2D ring scanner is put forward. Next, from the \nanalysis  of  the  load  pattern,  a  new  layout  was designed  for  staging  purposes  of  shipments  of \ndifferent  locations,  but  the  implementation  has  been  halted  due  to  the  prevailing  COVID-19 \nsituation to check for the results. \nThe second project involved in extracting the data from various portals and then analyzing it to \nfind the impact of NC misses due to fluid and bag miss-staging. After analyzing the data, some \ndesign of experiments were proposed which has been implemented at the site. On collecting the \ndata after implementation, the results showed a significant decrease in the miss-staging of the \nshipments. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): MS  Word,  MS  Excel,  MS  PowerPoint,  Microsoft \nOutlook, Advanced Excel, VBA, MySQL Workbench, Amazon trans logistics tools. \n \nObjectives of the project: Project 1 - Improvising ZBS (Zonal Based Sortation) in the staging \narea - Increase  the  scan  rate  in  the  ZBS  layout  from  4  scans / min  to  10  scans / min  by \nidentifying  the  blockades  and  implementing  new  ways  to  enhance the  scan  rate  and to further \nanalyze the same. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Both  the  projects  assigned  to  me  helped  in  improving  the \nperformance  of  the  site  where  I  worked  as  in  it  attributed  in  increasing  the  scan  rate  of  the \n\n80 \n \nshipments which resulted in a better productivity of the site and the new layout designed for the \nstaging purpose will result in lesser in-facility losses of the shipments and proper staging as the \nshipments  will  be  stacked  in  a  pallet  according  to  their  locations  with  proper  wrapping  around \nthem to avoid any falling. Also, the experiments done for the second project helped in reducing \nthe  misses  at  the  site  due  to  miss-staging  which  was  one  of  the  major  blockers  in  the \nimprovement of the performance of the site. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: It was a great \nexperience  working with Amazon for 5 months. The company gave me immense opportunities \nto  work  upon  my  soft  skills  alongside  technical  and  management  skills.  I  was  exposed  to  a \nvariety of situations and had ample opportunity to scale up my leadership and decision making \nabilities.   This   has   helped   me   become   an   effective   people   manager   and   improved   my \ncommunication  abilities.  Also,  the  projects  were  quite  challenging  in  nature  and  it  would  have \nnot been completed within the prescribed time without the constant help and guidance from my \nmentor, manager and other operations managers.

The aim was to connect all the packages coming to my facility \nto next one within a desired time. If any packages dwell more than desired time it will add to the \nageing.  This  happens  due  to  variety  of reasons  including  bag  level  receive,  damage,  inner \ncontent  miss  etc.  The  goal  is  to  eliminate  these  causes  to  get  as  much  as  ageing  as  we  can. \nHere escalation mails were sent to previous node for bag level missing packages.

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort summary of work done during PS-II: At Amazon FC (warehouse), damage generation \nand amnesty generation are two critical indicators of quality. Items that are accepted at the FC \nand  get  damaged  before  shipping  are  termed  as  warehouse  damage.  Warehouse  damage \ncosts  the  FC  in  terms  of  seller  reimbursements.  It  also  affects  ability  of  FC  in  delivering  the \ncustomer order within promised time. At the FC, the products are kept in shelves in small units \ncalled  bins.  A  bin had  physical  inventory  and  a  virtual  record  of  it.  When  a  customer  places \norder,  it  gets  attached  to  products  in  specific  bin,  and  only  that  bin  can  be  used  to  fulfill  it. \nHence,  it  is  critically  important  that  physical  items  and  virtual  records  agree  all  the  time.  A \nsource of mismatch in these is when a product falls down from a bin. This is called an amnesty \nitem.  Amnesty  costs  the  FC  in  terms  of  manpower  allocated  to  rectify  the  mismatch,  risk  to \ncustomer promise and possibility of product getting damaged due to the impact. In this project, I \nanalysed  various  processes in  FC  involving  inventory  movement.  From  this, I  found  out  1 \nstructural  improvement,  1  process  fail  points,  1  improvement  area  for  human  errors.  For  the \nprocess  fail  point,  I  recommended  a  tool  modification,  which  has  potential  to  reduce  25%  of \nwarehouse  damage.  From  the  improvement  process  of  human  errors,  we  are  seeing  ~30% \ndecrease  in  WD  in  that  process.

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: I  was assigned  a  very  interesting  project  called \n'Reducing  Network  Loss  in  Mobile  Phones'.  Amazon  faces  a  problem of  loss / theft  of  mobile \nphones  in  it's  supply / delivery  chain.  To  mitigate  this  problem,  this  project  aimed  at  digitally \nlocking / unlocking  mobile  phones  when  they  are  in  transit  so  that  even  if  they  are  stolen,  the \nmobile phones are not usable. My  work was to implement a backend automated workflow that \nwould be triggered by events such as delivery event, return event, etc. and perform operations \non remote devices through API calls for locking / unlocking them. The project was implemented \nonly  for  Samsung  mobile  phones  as  currently,  only  Samsung  provides  the  functionality  to \ndigitally lock mobile phones through their Knox program. The project consisted of a forward leg \nin which the phone is ordered through Amazon and delivered to the customer and a reject leg in \nwhich  a  phone  order  is  rejected  by  the  customer  and  it  is  returned  back  to  an  Amazon  FC. \n\n116 \n \nSamsung  Knox  required  that  the  phone  was  enrolled  in  their  database  before  any  locking / \nunlocking operations, so the forward leg requirement was to enroll the mobile phone when it is \nout  for  delivery  and  unenroll  it  when  it  is  delivered  to  the  customer.  Also,  if  the  phone  is  not \ndelivered within 10 days from the day it was shipped, it is considered lost or stolen and it has to \nbe locked. In the reject leg, when the phone starts it's journey back to the warehouse, it has to \nbe locked and then it is unlocked when it reaches the warehouse. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java, AWS tools such as SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, \nCloudFormation, CloudWatch, Lambda, CDK, S3, etc. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  design  an  automated  workflow \nthat  gets  triggered  on internal  Amazon  events  such  as  delivery  event, reject  event,  etc.  and \nperforms  operations  on  remote  devices  to  digitally  lock  and unlock  them  when  they  are  in \ntransit. \nMajor learning outcomes: Proficiency in  Java,  Dagger,  Junit,  Design  patterns, Proficiency  in \nAWS tools such as DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Lambda. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: Not applicable. \n \nBrief   description   of   working environment,   expectations   from   the   company: In   my \ninternship at Amazon, I felt more like a full-time SDE taking an active part in my team's projects \nand   day-to-day   tasks.   Team   members   were   extremely   helpful   and   inclusive.   I   had   an \nexponential  learning  curve  because  all  the  tools  were  new  to  me.  However,  there  was  a  lot of \npressure from the manager for completing the project as it this project had a significant business \nimpact and a very strict timeline. I had to work outside regular office hours to get the work done. \nInterns at Amazon are expected to learn quickly (even faster than FTEs) and deliver projects in \na short time. I got the opportunity to work on the most interesting projects in the team and using \nthe  latest  technology.  Overall,  I  got  a  good  head start  at  Amazon  for  my  career  in  terms  of \ntechnical knowledge and corporate experience, but work-life balance was slightly lacking. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Object   Oriented   Programming,   Database \nSystems, Data Structures and Algorithms. \n \n\n117"

The first project involved externalisation of Amazon tools to the public network with \nadded  security  so  that  they  could  be  used  in  the  3PL  warehouses.  This  included  a  lot  of \ncomputer networking concepts like request, ports, vips and infrastructure creation as well. I got \nto externalise a tool whose architecture had to be changed from Middleman Ruby to Java spring \nbecause  the  backend  couldn't  be  externalised  due  to  security  concerns.  I  got  the  exposure  to \ndevelop  the  spring  application  from  scratch.  The  second  project  revolved  around  adding  RTL \nsupport to an application to render content in Arabic locale when chosen. This involved working \non the frontend including JSP, Apache tiles, CSS and HTML. The third project was development \nof an android application in Kotlin using the FIDO2 API to authenticate warehouse associates. \nThis was another great learning experience since I had no knowledge whatsoever about android \nand its functioning. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java spring MVC, JavaScript, JSP, AWS, Kotlin, \nAndroid. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: 1.  Developing  a  spring  application  from  scratch  to  serve  static \ncontent of Middleman Ruby application and make AJAX calls to the backend API 2. Adding RTL \nsupport   for   Arabic   to   an   application   3.   Developing   an   android   application   for   FIDO2 \nauthentication. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: 1.  Java  Spring  MVC - I  knew  a  little  bit  of  Java  before  this \ninternship,  but  had  never  worked  on  any  large  scale  Java  codebase.  I  got  to  know  about \nannotations, Spring MVC functionalities and how it has made development a lot easier. \n2. Kotlin and android - I explored a lot in this domain as I had no knowledge and the task was a \nlittle complex. I got a great exposure on an activity, its lifecycle and learnt Kotlin along the way. \n3. Frontend stack - I had not worked on HTML or CSS before.

An order can \nbe cancelled after the order has been placed until the order has been shipped. Once the order \ngets  shipped  it  cannot  be  cancelled  but  it  can  be  returned.  When  cashback  has  been  issued \nafter  the  order  is  confirmed  and then the  order gets  cancelled,  we  observe  abuse  cases  while \nclawing back issued cashback when the cancellation workflow goes through OMA or PCE.

Then,  setup  the  pipeline  and  packages \nrequired  for  the  purpose  of  hosting  the  UI  and  setup  the  necessary  AWS  infrastructure  for \ncommunication between the frontend and the backend where the tool resides. Finally, complete \nall the tasks lining up to the prod push with end-to-end testing in a CICD form and hence deliver \nthe product to business.I started by performing a deep dive to learn the project’s requirements \nand  establish  a  set  of  tenets.  Following  which,  I  finished  up  my  ramp  up  tasks  and  performed \n\n126 \n \ndeep  dive  on  the  technologies  involved  and  began  working  on  a  delivery  plan  for  the  project. \nThen,  I  documented the  appropriate frameworks  and  compared them.  After  organizing  a  team \nreview, I applied the given feedback and choose Katal framework for the UI. Moving to the next \nphase, I performed a deep dive into Katal and AWS CDK. Once confident enough, I created the \nrequired  packages  and pipeline  for  hosting the UI  in  AWS  CloudFront. I  extended  the  pipeline \nuntil the prod stage simultaneously working on the actual UI. I raised CR with 96% unit testing \ncoverage and presented a demo for the same to the team. As for the AWS integration, I again \nperformed  a  deep  dive  and  documented  all  the  suitable  approaches  and  organized  a  team \nreview.  Based  off  of  team  feedback  and  factors  such  as  security  and  ease  of  integration,  I \nchoose  the  most  suitable  approach  and  implemented  it.  The  next  major  goal  was  beta  stage, \ntherefore I started with the most important tasks required for beta testing including setting up a \nNova domain and added custom CloudFront template with CR, migrated the cloud infrastructure \nto CDK package with CR, integration testing of UI with CR, making changes to backend for API \nrequests with CR, then I performed manual beta testing and the PVT in prod is ongoing. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): I have definitely improved my skills in the domain \nof code quality, version control, languages and document writing.

				"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary of work done during PS-II: I was assigned a total of 3 major projects during \nthe course of my internship. The first was related to automation of alarms related to my team's \nservice.  The  existing  process  of  manually  creating  and  updating  alarms  is  not  scalable  and  is \ntedious  to  do  for  large  sets  of  alarms.  I  automated  this  using  Live  Pipeline  Templates,  a  tool \nused  to  programmatically  create  pipeline,  Apollo  stages,  alarms  and  dashboards.  For  my \nsecond  project,  I  had  to  accommodate  a  list  of  holidays  within  the  exception  dates  attribute \nwithin  customer  delivery  profile.  The  previous  functionality  allowed  customers  to  opt  out  of \ndelivery  on  federal  holidays  each  of  which  could  be  associated  with  only  one  date.  I  extended \nthis to include a list of holidays, such as in Diwali or Eid. For my final project, I had to include a \nlocker accessibility option as an additional address attribute. In certain specific locations in the \nUS, lockers had been introduced so that packages could be safely delivered when a customer \nwas not at home. I had to include an option for the customer to opt for delivery to a lower locker \n\n129 \n \nslot. This feature will be helpful for differently abled people to collect their parcels.

The idea was to use native AWS technology, which would be \nsupported for  a  longer  duration  of  time  such  that  the  system  has  a  long  lifetime.  The  project's \nscope  included  work  estimation,  coding,  testing, and  code  deployment. The  aim  was  to give  a \nbuild a fully functional configuration management service within the duration of the internship. \nSince a new service was needed, I first had to setup the pipeline and create new packages for \nthe  code.  Then,  I  learnt  the  various  AWS  (Amazon  Web  Services)  technologies  that  were \nneeded as part of the project like Lambda, AppConfig, CDK, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB and \nmore. After a basic design approach was set, I started writing code, one API at a time, building it \nend to end along with the integration test files. The main code was contained in AWS Lambda \n\n135 \n \nfunctions(which  activate  and  run  the  code  based  on  a  trigger)  and  I  spent  most  of  my  time \nwriting  them  using  relevant  Java  software  development kits.  The  testing  was  mostly  on  AWS \nAPI  Gateway  to  verify  the  output for the  different  operations. I  used  AWS  CDK  to  build  all  the \ncloud  infrastructure  needed  for  my  service.  This  was  really  useful  as  now  the  service \ninfrastructure could easily be replicated to different AWS accounts and even be rendered out as \na template to allow easy building of infrastructure. Towards the end, I spent most of my time on \ncode  reviews.  Once  the  code  reviews  were  done,  the  project  was  completed  and  pushed  to \nproduction.  Finally,  I  needed  to  create  good  documentation  for  future  reference.  This  was \nparticularly important as the system will be modified in the future as and when the need arises, \nand a good documentation goes a long way in code maintainability. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): AWS technologies like Lambda, CDK, AppConfig, \nS3, DynamoDB, SNS, CloudFormation. \nProgramming Languages - Java, JavaScript, TypeScript. \nInternal Amazon development tools. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: My  team  at  Amazon  had  been  using  a  legacy  configuration \nmanagement system for some time. Now, that system was being deprecated and needed to be \nreplaced with a new system. My project was to build a new Configuration Management System \nfor  my  team.  The  idea  was  to  use  native  AWS  technology,  which  would  be  supported  for  a \nlonger  duration  of  time  such  that  the  system  has  a  long  lifetime.  The  project's  scope  included \nwork  estimation,  coding,  testing,  and  code  deployment.  The  aim  was  to  give  a  build  a  fully \nfunctional configuration management service within the duration of the internship. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: My  journey from  campus  to  corporate  was  amazing.  I  learnt  a  lot \nabout Amazon and my team's work. More importantly, I learnt the soft skills needed to work in a \ncorporate  environment.   Regular   meetings,   one-on-ones,   and  stand-ups   with  my   mentor, \nmanager, and other team members were enriching and helped me be a better professional. As \nan add-on, I got the opportunity to learn many new and modern technologies, which will help me \nin  my  future  projects.  I  learnt  a  lot  of  AWS  technologies.  These  technologies  are  used  by \nworldwide  customers.  Hence,  this  experience  will  be  useful  for  me  in  any  of  AWS  consumer \ncompanies as well. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n\n136 \n \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Amazon  is  a \ngreat place to work if you are looking for exciting work and writing code that will directly impact \ncustomers.  There  will  be  a  lot  of  learning  opportunities.  A  mentor  will  be  assigned  to  you  for \nproject related queries. Although, work can get a little hectic at times, the overall experience for \nme was amazing. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Data  Structures  and  Algorithms, Data  Bases, \nObject Oriented Programming, Software Engineering."

These need to abide by a set of regulations set by global \n\n140 \n \ngoverning  bodies. To  check  their  compliance,  every  creative  needs to go  through  a \"checklist\" \nand a human reviewer answers each question, which can be quite dull and arduous. \nMy task during this internship, was to build a tool where this process can become easier. So, \n1.  I  first  added  some  new functionalities  to  the  VC  (Version  Control)  tool  that  helps  reviewers \ncompare different versions of a creative. \n2.  I  wrote  code  for  Comment-Interpretation,  so  as  to  automatically  check  if  the  previously \nmarked corrections have been made. \n3. I built the platform for automated MCR. Here, the checklist is suppressed (based on metadata \nand the responses to a questionnaire), then data elements are extracted from the creative and \nthe checklist is re-prioritized. Then, T&C validation, data field-validation and checklist-validation \n(partial) is performed, and an error report is generated, to be sent back to the marketer. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Python, PostgreSQL, HTML, REST framework. \nObjectives  of  the  project: I  had  to  build a  platform  for  automating  the  marketing  creative \nreview  process  that  every  creative  review  produced  my  American  Express  must  go  through. \nThis  includes  refining  the  Version  Control  tool,  automating  the  compliance  checklist and \nautomating through MCR. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: 1.

The \nproblem  of  distortion  is  prevalent  in the  aerospace  manufacturing  industry,  be  it  titanium, \naluminium or even in inconel. Boeing and Airbus lost millions of dollars in scrap because of this. \nResidual  Stress  is  considered  as main  culprit  behind  the  distortion.  So  in  this  project  I  studied \nresidual  stress  and  measured  it  through  X-ray  diffraction  method.There  are  various  methods \nthrough  which  stresses  can  be  measured.  In  this  project  I  understood  about  the  causes  of \nresidual   stresses   be   it   mechanical   or   heat   treatment   processes.   Also   I   made   some \nrecommendations in the process change i.e 1st machining setup before heat treatment. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : X-ray Diffraction setup, DEFORM can be used \n \n\n79 \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : To  understand  the  causes  of  distortion  by  studying  residual \nstresses and ways to minimize distortion \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Understood  about  the  residual  stresses,  their  measurement \nmethods,  Metallurgical  aspects  of  Ti6Al4V  alloy,  micro-structure,  tensile  and  other  testing \nnecessary  for  aerospace  parts.

Thus, \nthrough  this  study,  we  address  if  high  glucose  stress  given  to  parental  generation  can  have \neffects  on  subsequent  two  generations  in  terms  of their  AGEs  levels.  In  addition  to  this,  I  was \n\n215 \n \nalso  checking  if  an  antiglycation  agent,  carnosine  can  combat  the  effects  caused  by  high \nglucose  stress  in  subsequent  generations.  Candida elegans  was  used  as  the  model  organism \nfor all the studies. As the hyperglycemic state observed in diabetic patients can be mimicked in \nC. elegans, it is considered as one of the ideal models for diabetes related studies. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): OriginPro 9.0, Fluorescence spectroscopy, FT-IR, \nELISA. \n \nObjectives of the project: To evaluate the effect of high glucose stress on AGEs levels in C. \nelegans. To check for AGE levels in the subsequent generation worms upon glucose stress to \nthe  parental  generation.  To  evaluate  the  impact  of  an  antiglycation  agent  on  AGEs  levels  of \nglucose stressed worms. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes:  Learnt the  handling  and  maintenance  of model  organism,  C. \nelegans.  Learnt about  planning  and  designing of  the  experiments  as  well  as the  operation  of \nvarious instruments. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  PS  at \nCLRI  was  a  good  learning  experience.

As  an  intern  in  the  organization,  they  suggest  you  appropriate  tasks  that  may \nbenefit  you  the  most.  Structure  of  the  organization  is  rigid  but  the higher  level  managers are \nquite  approachable  and  open  to  suggestions.

This testing framework \ncompletely automates this picking up new SDKs in regular intervals and testing it with ECS on a \ndaily basis. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : IDEA intellij, Visual studio \n \nObjectives of the project : To create a test framework to certify the compatibility of ECS with \nAWS S3 protocol \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learned more about AWS S3, got to understand junit and testng \nframework,  became  more  familiarized  with  Java,  understood  the  working  of  an  object  storage \nand how it works \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Work \nenvironment is actually good in Dell EMC. The whole team is so helping. They appreciate and \nrecognize  each  other.  Company  expects  you  to  finish  the  work  given  to  you  in  perfect  way \nbefore the deadline and they will encourage us to do it also. Even when there was no need for \ndirector to talk us, who is in another country, he found time to just get to know us. The work life \nbalance  is  also  great  there.  Noone  expects  you  to  stay  late  in  the  office  or  log  these  many \nhours. What  matters  is  whether  you  are  completing  the  work.  For  whatever  concerns  you  can \nalways talk to your manager also. So totally I can say that it is a pretty good company to work \nfor. \n \n\n152 \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : DSTN, Cloud computing, OS"

My manager was also very proficient and rather empathetic. \n- They peers and mentors are pretty helpful and friendly. \n- You're expected to contribute to actual features in a fast paced environment. \n- They gave the 3 of us PS interns MacBook pros.  \n- Work timings were flexible and no issues if you can get the work done in time, but this is really \ndependent on your manager / mentor. \n- The  HR  seemed  to  be  in  a  disarray,  and  the  company  is  not  doing  financially  really  well \ncurrently. \n- Also got the impression that the marketing department is not doing very well when in fact, their \nproduct is really dependent on marketing & sales. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Not really. You need knowledge of the tech stack \nthe company is working with above anything else. Advantage of course knowledge from CSE is \nlimited. \n \n \n\n242"

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: I  did  not  have  any  idea  of  web  development \nbefore  I joined,  so  I  started  by  rewriting  snippets  of  code  to  make  them  conformant  to  the \nconfigured  linting  rules.  Later,  I  wrote  a  custom  lint  rule  for  a  pattern  not  picked  up  by  any \nexisting rules. It was pretty cool, since I had to identify the pattern by traversing the AST. These \nexercises  also  helped  me  understand  React,  the  codebase  and  frontend  development  in \ngeneral. After  that,  I  had  to  refactor  an  existing  component,  which  happened  to  be  the  main \nfeature on the website's second most visited page. It was a notoriously buggy component and \nthe code was a mess. The refactoring was tricky - since it  was a relatively  long-term project, I \nhad  to  incorporate  new  features  requests  concurrently.  I  reduced  code  complexity,  response \ntime  and  memory  footprint  across  the  board.  I  also  made  it  more  reliant  on  W3C  specs  and \nbehaviours,  so  it  allowed  for  minimal  effort  when  adding  support  for  other  browsers.  For  good \nmeasure,   I   then   refactored   the   most   visited   page   too. I   also   worked   on   styling   the \ndocumentation site for the product. It was managed by a third party service, so I was basically \nhacking  my  way  around  their  default  styling  and  behaviours  through  pure  CSS  and  HTML \nscripts - bare-metal  frontend  development  if  you  will. In  the  last  third  of  my  internship,  I  was \nincluded in the sprint cycle - from planning to testing.

I  didn't  know  any  web  development,  so  the  team  sort  of  took  me \nunder their wing to make sure I learnt a bit of everything. They were always happy to help out, \noften going out of their way to make sure that my learning was unimpeded. The engineers are \nalso pretty smart, and it was easier to ask the guy sitting next to me rather than to think about \nwhat  search  query  to  type  in.  The  company  has  these  weekly  learning  sessions,  where \nsomeone  would  present  a  new  technology  (not  necessarily  being used  by  the  company) and \nthen we could discuss it. It also served as a way to get cross team discussion going, and good \nideas often bubbled up during these sessions. They're also pretty chill about work hours, it was \nmainly  about  being  in  office  so that  you  could  attend meetings  in  person.

Primary project was “Representation of Wiring Harness on Abaqus”.

However, such simulations are computationally expensive and time \nconsuming. Additionally, there can only exist finite computational resources. To make the most \nof it, it would be efficient to reduce the complexity of design by representing bulky components \nwith  their  simplified  versions.  This  project  aims  to  create  a  reduced  1-D  model  for  a  wiring \nharness cable using beam elements to be used as simplified model in larger assemblies, while \ncapturing the material behaviour accurately. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Learnt some industry leading software used by the CAE experts in \nthe team.

The  registration  workflow  was  also  in  a \nsimilar  state  earlier  but  was  refactored  recently,  the  same  was  done  for  un-registration  in  this \nproject.  \n\n535 \n \n1) A task-based framework has been added over the un-registration workflow - We create one \nparent task which tracks the progress of several child tasks .Currently in the un-registration flow, \nthere  are  several  small  sub  processes,  we  make  a  child  task  for  each  of  these  sub-\nprocesses.As  the  child  tasks get  completed,  we  move  forward  the  progress  of  parent Task.  In \ncase any of the child task fails, the parent task automatically fails. Only if all the child tasks get \nsuccessfully completed, we mark the parent task as completed. \n2) Cleanup, which was earlier performed using a Python script, now has been added as a part \nof  un-registration  workflow - For  migrating  these  clean-up  scripts,  I  had  to  understand  how  to \nconstruct  complex  IDF  queries  inside  the  prism  gateway  codebase. In  order  to  successfully \nimplement  these  I  coordinated  with  the  IDF  team  and  got  their  review  as  well  after  successful \nimplementation. \n3)  An  annotation  based  method  of  declaring  pre-checks  and  cleanups - This  solution  involves \ncreating two custom annotations, one for pre-check and one for clean-up. Any team can declare \ntheir pre-check and clean-up functions in their own class with these annotations. The annotation \nprocessor will automatically add these to the un-registration workflow. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Maven - Apache Maven is a software project and \ndependency management tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven \ncan  manage  a  project's  build,  the  version  of  dependencies  to  be  used  and  several  other \nproperties in a central manner.  \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  of  the  project  was  to  refactor  the  un-registration \nworkflow  and  get rid  of the flaws  associated  with  it.  Some  of refactoring changes: 1.  Adding a \ntask based framework 2. Adding Zookeeper check to avoid race condition 3. Writing a custom \nannotation processor and generator. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I learnt how  to  use  Nutanix  tools  and  libraries  to  quickly  and \nefficiently   create,  manage  new   packages   and   services.Creating   detailed   and  descriptive \ndocumentation was another key learning I had. The design docs helped me to understand how \nto  analyse  a  problem  and  its  requirements,  come  up  with  multiple  solutions,  identify  their \nassumptions,  pros  and  cons,  etc.Some  of  the  frameworks  and  libraries  I  learnt  as  part  of  this \nproject are spring boot, Rest, JUnit, Java Poet, etc. I also learnt how to  write proper unit tests \nthat  cover  all  possibilities  and  scenarios.I  learnt  the  importance  of  proper  logging  through  this \ninternship. All the bug tickets that were assigned to me in this internship had the log files. Ability \n\n536 \n \nto  read  and  search  the  logs  in  an  efficient  manner  was  one  of  my  key  learnings.  This  also \nhelped me realize what all things I should log in my own code for good readability of my logs in \nfuture.Code  reviews  helped  me  a  lot  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  code  I  write  and  familiarize \nmyself  with  the  various  tech  practices  present  in  the  industry.  The  review  also  helped  me  to \nunderstand how to find bugs and resolve them. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment  at  Nutanix  is  extremely  positive.  All  the  team  members  were  available  to  me  and \nwere  very  helpful  at  every  stage.  They  provided  constant  support,  motivation  and  guidance \nthroughout my internship.This internship was great opportunity for me to interact with people in \ndifferent roles at Nutanix.It made me aware about the latest technologies used in the industry.It \nwas a great place to experiment, learnt from the mistakes and find my interest field. It was also \nwonderful  chance  to improve  my  communication  and  presentation  skills.  After  completing  this \ninternship,  I  am  confident that  i  have  learnt  a  lot and  I  am  much more  confident for  my  career \nahead. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Computer architecture and Nutanix Codebase."

The \nprimary  focus  of  our  work  was  to  develop novel  approach  to  handle  virtual  machine  live \nmigrations. One of the major problems in VM live migration is memory dirtying. Dirtying refers to \nthe modification of any memory page owned by the VM. Frequently dirtied memory needs to be \ntransferred  repeatedly  over  the  entire  duration  of  migration.  As  a  result,  when  the  memory \ndirtying  rate  is  high  and  network  bandwidth  is  limited,  migration  may  not  converge.  Throttling \nVMs to reduce vCPU execution time is the current approach in QEMU to handle such cases of \n\n537 \n \nhigh memory dirtying. Existing throttling algorithms throttle all the vCPUs of a VM, penalise read \nand  write  processes  across  all  vCPUs  equally.  We developed new  dirty  quota  based throttling \nalgorithm  that  selectively  throttles  vCPUs  based  on  their  individual  contribution  to  overall \nmemory  dirtying  and  also  dynamically  adapts  the  throttle  based  on  the  available  network \nbandwidth. Our approach drastically reduced migration times and also enabled the convergence \nof migrations in P99 and P99.9 cases which was not possible before. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): C, Vim, Git, Crash, kprobe. \n \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Devise  a  vCPU,  aware  VM  live  migration  algorithm  that  enables \nfaster convergence of live migrations. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: Strengthened  my  OS  and  memory  management  concepts,  learnt \nvirtualisation  from  scratch, good  understanding  of  KVM  and  QEMU  codebases,  gained  Linux \nkernel development and debugging experience.  \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: I  found  the \nworking environment at the company was very good.

These tests are written to verify the different functionalities of the context switching \nunit and the various safety features implemented to make it industry functional safety standard \ncompliant. A bug / error is caught when running regressions of such tests on the main unit (DUT \n– Device  under Test),  in  our  case  the  Context  switch  unit.  There  were  many  types  of  debugs \nthat were  performed.  In  many  cases  the  error  was  found  to  be  in  the  tests  (test  not  correctly \nanticipating  the  behavior  of  the  DUT  under  certain  conditions).  In  numerous  cases, the  debug \nprocess resulted in corrections in the design of the microcode. Sometimes, a bug may also be \nfound  at  the  RTL  code  level  in  which  case  appropriate  changes  need  to  be  made  in  the  RTL \ncode. The  extensive  debugging  process  also  lead  to  more  and  more  clarity  of  the  unit  and  its \nbasic  functionalities.  Continuous  study  of  the  internal  architecture  and  verification  specification \ndocuments in parallel aided the learning process. \nOther  than  debugging  tasks,  many  coverage  tasks  were  also  completed.  As  per  requirements \nfor functional  safety,  its  important that  our testbench  covers  all  the sections  of  the  DUT,  i.e  all \npossible scenarios are hit. This ensures every line of the DUT code is hit at-least once to ensure \nthere  are  NO  blind  spots  in  the  DUT  design.  The  same  testcases  written  for  functional \nverification can also be modified to include scenarios to hit boundary cases that may not get HIT \nin  the  normal  course  of  the  GPU / unit’s operation. Separate directed test sequences were \ncreated  to  hit  corner  cases.  A  cumulative  report  gets  generated  in  the  end  which  gives  a \ncomprehensive evaluation of line as well as conditional code coverage. It marks the section of \nDUT code which were not hit by the tests. In which case, a further analysis needs to be done, \nas to why / what lead to this. And an appropriate stimulus or a checker needs to be added to Hit \nthe missed cases. Many times, a MISS may occur due to some corner case inside a loop which \nnever  gets  hit.  Such  cases  are  solved  by  implementing  a  checker  in  test  to  hit  that  case  by \nspecifically sending a particular argument to that code snippet. \nFinally, a lot of experience was gained while  working upon these tasks while at the same time \nenjoying it due to the detective like nature of the work. Finding out bugs, solving them and at the \nsame time meet deadlines to contribute to the team working towards a common goal was very \nexciting as well as enlightening. \n \n\n416 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Verdi wave viewer, Perforce version management \nsystem, NVBUGS bug tracking system. \n \nObjectives of the project: To achieve functional safety compliance of the context switching unit \nof Nvidia GPUs for automotive applications. \n \nMajor   learning outcomes: Functional   verification   and   testing   methodology.

The  technology  allows  for simultaneous access to services  on \nthe mobile network. But there is a disadvantage to it that for minimizing hardware consumption \nwe have only one trans-receiver for both the sim. As a result, whenever the network (EnodeB) \nallocates the resources to a dual sim phone some of the resources go as  waste because at a \ntime we have only one sim active.

So, in this task, \nthe initial calculations comprises of calculation of no. of RE’S acquired by LTE channels (csrs, \nsss, pss, pbch) and no. of RE’s acquired by SSB (combination of sss, pss  and  pbch)  and \nCoreset 0 (Pdcch 0) in 5G NR. So as a final result, it is proved that SSB and Coreset 0 played a \ncrucial role in 5G NR, as in this less RE (resources) were acquired by them compared to more \nRE acquired by LTE channels. The major reason was CSRS was not here in NR due to which \nthe saved RE’s were utilized  for  data  instead  of physical  layer  channels, which  indirectly  gave \nrise to more throughput (data rate) in NR and less bandwidth wastage as compared to LTE. As \nan  add  on    some  simulations  of  LTE  modules  was  done  on  NS3  software,  from  which  the \nresultant plots like  path loss effect v/s increasing distance of UE (user) from enB, sinr  effect v/s \nincreasing distance of UE (user) from enB were observed. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): LTE downlink resource element visualization tool, \nmatlab, Ns3 software. \n \nObjectives of the project: ESTIMATION OF OVERHEAD DUE TO REFERENCE SIGNALS IN \nLTE & NR BASED NETWORKS. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understood overhead due to Reference signals resource elements \n(REs) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) networks. At physial layer, reference / \npilot signals are used for control, signaling and synchronization tasks accurately computing the \noverhead REs is necessary to achieve an efficient system design. The current study is aimed at \nexploring  the  influence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  downlink  performance.  Current  work  modelled \nall  overheads  for  synchronization,  controlling  and signaling  operations  in  LTE/NR  physical \ndownlink  shared / control channels.  This  allows  for  dynamically  computing  the  useful  REs  (by \nsubtracting  the  overhead  REs  from  the  total  ones),  both  per  Transmission  Time  Interval  (TTI) \nand  per  frame  (and  hence,  the  corresponding  bit  rates).  Our  data  rate-based  performance \nmodel is able to accurately compute the real, exact system data rate or “throughput” (instead of \napproximations). Aiming at understanding the impact of each overhead mechanism, carried out \na  variety  of  simulations and  the  simulation  results  prove  our  starting  hypothesis  that  the \ninfluence  of  overhead  on  LTE/NR  performance  should  not  be  neglected.  Finally, the  model \nquantifies  to  what  extent  throughput  gets  improved  in  NR  systems  over  LTE  with  reduced \noverhead REs. \n\n529 \n \nDetails of papers / patents: NA. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nculture  was  amazing with  all  talented, enthusiastic  and  passionate  people  around  me.

There is a need to \nreduce  this  period  by  making  available the  Inspection  data  at  the  very  starting  stage  to  the \ndesigner so that it will be easier for the designer to make decisions while deciding the tolerance \nvalues  for  a  process.  This  can  be  done  by  storing  the  product  data  and  corresponding \ninspection data in a common database and using this data for decision making with the help of \ndifferent Machine learning techniques. This project work focussed on developing and integrating \na  module  into  SIEMENS  NX,  such  that  recommendation  on  dimensioning  and  tolerancing  can \nbe  provided  to  help  in  predictive  modeling.  Multiple  prototypes  were  developed  for  predictive \nmodelling  as  spread  across  as different  NX  applications  like  modelling, assembly, inspection \nand  CMM.

After  about  a  month,  I  tracked  and  analysed  delivery  metrics  and \nworked  towards  optimizing  deliveries.  The  work  involved  finding  why  deliveries  are  not  getting \ndelivered and analysing that data through various cuts and angles : payment mode wise, region \nwise,  buyer  profile  wise,  delivery  time  wise  etc.  Later  on,  I shifted  to  a  new  team  as  Financial \nPlanning  and  Analysis  of  newly  launched  Fresh  category.  Here,  my  work  involved  building  all \ndata  related  processes  from  scratch  to  capture  and  analyse  a  variety  of  information.

Since most people at Udaan are \nbuilding a business like this for the first time in their lives, questions, and sharing of knowledge \nis  highly  encouraged.    The  people  encourage  new  ideas  and  fully  support  you  to  get  them \nimplemented,  unless  there's  a  very  sound  reasoning  that  they're  too  dumb.  It's  a  very  healthy \nenvironment that way. The only expectation people have  is that you own your  work. If a job is \nassigned to you, make sure you do it as perfectly as possible, and update on whether there are \nerrors  or  whether  some  help  is  required  to  complete.  It's  either  do-it-or-inform-what's-the-\nblocker-so-i-can-help  kind  of  culture.

It takes  a  2V  DC  input  and \ngenerates  a  regulated  output  of  8V  DC.  The  charge  pump  is  supported  by  a  clock  signal  of  a \nperiod  of  40ns.  There  are essentially  three  functional  blocks  in  a  charge  pump  system, clock-\ngenerator circuit, charge pump and a comparator. The comparator block consists of a two-stage \nOTA. Since, in a comparator design, high gain is very essential, therefore, the two-stage OTA is \ndesigned.  Opamp  compensation  is  carried  out  to  make  sure  the  closed  loop  configuration  is \nstable.  It  also  leads  to  good  settling  characteristics.  Two  most  popular  approaches  are \ndominant-pole compensation and lead compensation. In the four-phase clock generator circuit, \nfour clock signals are generated, out of which two are overlapping signals and the other two are \nnon-overlapping   signals.  The   overlapping   signals   are  the   inverted   versions  of   the   non-\noverlapping  ones.  Charge  pump  is  a  kind  of  DC–DC  converter  that  consists  capacitors  and  a \nswitch  network  controlled  by  some  clock  signals  only.  A  high  potential,  either  positive  or \nnegative, can be generated by the charge sharing actions among different capacitors during two \nor more  clock  phases.  Conventionally,  this  kind  of  circuits  was  implemented  using  diode-\nconnected NMOS switch network.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Cadence virtuoso and Finesim. \n\n605 \n \nObjectives of the project: • The significance of a charge pump system in memory circuits. \n• The working of a charge pump system and its functional blocks. \n• Understanding the process of designing circuits to achieve stability of a complex system. \n \nMajor learning  outcomes: • Understanding  various  concepts  of  analog  integrated circuit \ndesign. \n• Designing  stable  analog circuits  like,  two-stage  OTA,  clock-generator  circuit,  charge  pump, \netc. across all process corners. \n• Learning basic level scripting to access files from various directories. \n \nDetails of papers / patents: None. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Western Digital \n(SANDISK)  sets  out  to  achieve  its  goals  in  ethical,  honest  ways  with  an  elevated  sense  of \npurpose.

My  team  always  encouraged  creativity, \nproductivity, and thinking outside the box. Employees give 200%. They strive to be the best and \nto  deliver  top-quality  products  and  services.

Sometimes  we  add \nsuch functionalities to SDK which can only be validated by user. So we need changes in app UI \nto  show  results  to  the  user  so that  they  can  verify  them.  If  you  don't  have  a  scalable  UI,  ui \nchange  would  take  a  lot  of  development  time  as  well  as  effort.  So,  my  first  project  revolves \naround designing a scalable UI for dogfood app. \nMy  second  project  was  about  app  migration  from  Objective  C  to  Swift.  In  this  project  I  was \ninvolved in end to end development of app. We needed migration because nowadays swift has \ngain  much  more  popularity  over  Objective  C,  so  young  developer  prefer  to  start  their \ndevelopment carrer with swift.

I also tried out many variants of GANs \nto find the suitable variant for our project. I used Tensorflow and Pytorch for the coding of these \nGANs.  Further,  I  developed  an  end-to-end  GAN  pipeline  using  Python  and  Bash.  I  also \nparallelized  some  of  the  code  using  unix  commands  and  Bash.  I  learnt  a  lot  about  the \nproduction environment and the protocols that must be followed when deploying any software to \nthe production queue. I also learnt about the documentation formats followed in the company. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: No papers/patents were published as a part of internship project. \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The company \nprovided  a  very  friendly  and  guided  working  environment.  My  mentors  were  really  helpful  and \nguided me throughout the project. The timings were flexible and no hard deadlines were given.  \nOne can expect a very cooperative working environment in the company. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Neural  Networks  and  Fuzzy  Logic, Machine \nLearning."

Due  to  various  updates,  these  applications \nare now to be used for an even wider user base, thus requiring a large increase in the scale of \nthe deployments. This scaling if done on the on-premise servers, will lead to inefficiencies in the \nresource utilisation thus leading to extra cost incurred. It would also be highly time consuming to \nhost  them  on  the  bare  metal  servers  where  all  of  the  updation  and  management  is  done \nmanually. Thus, there is a need to shift to a system, which can allow us to scale the applications \nwithout  any  need  of  manual  intervention.  We  also  want  a  system,  where we  can  update  our \napplications  seamlessly  and  in  as  less  time  as  possible.  Thus,  we  look  into  the  Cloud  which \nprovides all of these functionalities.  \nFurther,  the  internal  framework  that  SCI  team  uses  to  develop  applications  is  currently  in  a \nMonolithic form, with all the services bundled tightly together. For any new developer, to use the \nframework,  he  needs  to  first  completely  understand  the  entire  framework  with  its  multiple \ndependencies  and  services.  But,  in  many  of  the  cases,  where  not  all  of  the  provided  services \nare required, this proves to be a bottleneck. The solution for this problem was to transform the \nframework into a micro service type, with each individual service hosted as a separate service \non the cloud or a bare metal server and be accessed using API requests. \n\n158 \n \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): S/w - Docker,  Kubernetes,  Springboot,  Python, \nAngular, Nginx, AWS. \n \nObjectives of the project: To shift team's application to cloud and further enhance the team's \ninternal framework. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: I learnt various new technologies such as Springboot and Angular.

The  employee  just  type  in  query  as  an \ninput and the bot pulls data from the production databases or appropriate portal and reply back \nto the user. The data is pulled in two ways, through direct connection to database and through \nRestful API. The Bot takes natural language input from the user, cleans the input and searches \nkeywords  from  it,  the  keywords  or  entities  are  collected  and  sent  to  the  routing  engine.  The \nrouting engine then tries to identify the intent of the user. When found, it routes the flow to the \nintended functionality with the entities as inputs. The specific function processes the entities and \nreturns the desired result, which is then pushed to the bot space. The Bot is made proactive in \nnature,  so  if  multiple  failures/Errors  happens,  the  bot  gives  a  notification  to  the  required  bot \nspace.  It  also  provides  a  link  in  description  where  the  problem  can  be  handled  from.  The  Bot \nalso  checks  changes/delta  in  logs,  if  any,  is  immediately  pushed  to  space.

Analysis of data, logs is done manual or with very little automation. Threat and bug \nevaluation  is  done  manually,  hence  time  consuming.  To  solve  this  problem,  Telephony  spark \nbot  helps  employees  to  get  access  to  data  easily,    faster  and  without  manual  authentication. \nThe  employees  can  access  data  just  by  chatting  with  the  Bot.

				"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Cisco  provides  multiple  solutions  in  order  to \nmanage  Firepower  Threat  Devices  (FTDs).  These  solutions  vary  in  terms  of scalability  and \noffering  of  various  features.  Firepower  Device  Manager  (FDM)  is  a  single-device  on-box \nmanagement  solution  that  manages  FTDs.  Firepower  Management  Centre  (FMC)  is  the \nadministrative  nerve  centre  for  managing  critical  Cisco  network  security solutions.  It  provides \ncomplete and unified management over firewalls, application control, intrusion prevention, URL \nfiltering, and advanced malware protection. Team can view details about customer video mesh \ndeployments.  Typically,  medium  and  large-scale customers  exceed  the  limit  of  number  of \ndevices managed by a single FMC or FDM instance. Hence, there is a need to migrate policies \nfrom one FMC to another or from one FDM to FMC. As part of this project, the idea is to develop \na robust framework that is capable of inputting different configuration data sources to FMC and \nachieve a data driven model converter. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Golang, Visual Studio Code, Github, Postman. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  project  consists  of  3  different  use  cases,  out  of  which  I  am \ninvolved with the 3rd use case, that is, Data Migration from FDM to FMC of the Data Migration \nService Development. The problem statement of the project is as follows: FDM and FMC both \nare  managers  for  FTD.  FDM  is  installed by  default  on  the  device  and  it  can  manage  just  that \ndevice.  FMC  can  manage  up  to  800 FTDs.  Every  time  a  customer  buys  an  FTD,  he  needs  to \n\n228 \n \nconfigure  an  FDM  to  manage  that  device.  Also,  the  FDM  provides  limited  features  while  the \nFMC  provides  multiple  features.  So,  the  same  FTD  is  managed  by  multiple  managers.  If  an \nFMC is provisioned for the customer, he will be liberated from managing multiple FDMs. All the \nFTDs  can  be  configured  and  managed  by  one  FMC  until  it  reaches  its  full  capacity,  when \nanother FMC  will be provisioned for the customer. So, the objective is to migrate configuration \nfrom Single-Device on-box manager (FDM) to Multi-Device Manager (FMC). \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Understanding the architecture and working of FMC and FDM, the \nvarious object configurations, software designing in industry, practical exposure to REST APIs, \nGo programming language, working with visual studio code, Git, REST APIs using Postman. \n \nDetails  of  papers/patents: A  survey  on  the  role  of  Internet  of  Things  for  adopting and \npromoting.

				"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary   of   work   done   during   PS-II: The   internship   at   Dell   Technologies, \nBangalore(Dell EMC) is quite structured. First few weeks involved general ramp up under hiring \nmanager. After this interns in our batch were allocated to specific teams where the next one-two \nweeks  involved  team  specific  ramp  up  which  also  involved  KT  sessions.  In  my  case  I  got  to \nwork with NetWorker product of EMC to take backup, perform restore etc. The KT sessions on \nNetWorker were helpful to get a brief understanding of NetWorker's operation. Dell handed over \nNetWorker development to HCL as part of transition. For the next project, I was part of SDNG \nteam  and  worked  with  DDSD  API. I  worked with senior  engineer  on  logging  functionality  for \n\n285 \n \nDDSD API and came up with macros/inline functions to replace conditional ENTRY/EXIT traces \nfor  logging.  To  successfully  complete  this  task  also  required  separating  the  APIs  according  to \ntheir functionality(backup/restore) and understanding the C code base for these APIs and relate \nwith  the  flow.  After  this, I  worked  on  two  Power  Protect  Data  Manager  bugs  for  DDSD  API. \nThese  bugs  were  associated  with  DDSD  API's  integration  with  PowerStore  storage  array.  I \ngained significant exposure to debugging and code flow while working on these bugs. I was able \nto close off one bug. Second one was a bit complex bug which I handed over to senior engineer \nafter my analysis. Lastly, I was alloted a JIRA story to add code for plugging a memory leak in \none of the APIs. I closed off the story successfully by adding the code, testing it and getting it \nreviewed from senior devs. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, VIM Editor, Perforce \nP4V client, VMware vSphere web client, Beyond Compare, Bugzilla, JIRA, Review Board Tool, \nWinSCP. \n \nObjectives of the project: Feature Implementation for DDSD API. \n \nMajor  learning  outcomes: I  was  exposed  to  industry-level  production  codes  for  the  first  time \nand able to contribute on a live project was truly a great experience for me. The transition from \ncollege to corporate was made easier due to this PS2 program. Along the way, I was exposed \nto many new tools/softwares that are used in a software development. Also just due to this PS2 \nprogram and project requirement here, I was able to learn JAVA. I was offered a PPO after the \nend of my internship as well. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: Nil \n \nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company: The \nenvironment at Dell Technologies(EMC) is very supportive. You can approach anyone right from \nthe engineer level to senior manager level at any time and they will always be available to guide \nyou. Moreover, the internship is very structured and they will take care of everything right from \nramp-ups to project allocation. The projects allocated arerelated to data protection. Even though \nthe internship was in a WFH mode, the timings are very flexible for interns. They just expect you \nto  complete  the assignments  on  time.  You  also interact  with  the  US  counterparts  during  team \n\n286 \n \nmeetings.

				"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort summary of work done during PS-II: Development - A new product feature was added \nto give support for GCP services. Account creation/updation/deletion services have been added. \nListing resources of the GCP account and allowing for on-demand snapshots was done. Audit of \naccount  related  activities  was  also  added to  show  what  tasks  were  done  and  their  respective \nstatus (completed/error/in-progress etc). \nDesign - As  AWS  and  Azure  platforms  are  already  supported,  help  was  taken  from  these \nservices, control  and  data  flow,  UI  design,  front  end user  input  checks  and generating  correct \napi-uri parameters were done. \nTesting - The newly generated UI for GCP and dashboard have been tested for various screen \nsizes,   browsers   (Chrome,   Mozilla   and   IE).   Validations   for   user   input   on   account \ncreation/updating  have  been  done.  Responses  from  various  api  calls  to  the  server  have  been \ntested to ensure correct information is displayed on UI. \nImprovement  in  productivity and  efficiency - As  new  preact  Javascript  library  have  been  used \nreplacing the older angular code, many api calls are reduced. Earlier many HTML, JS, CSS files \nwere  requested  from  server  for  a  single  view  but  Preact  has  reduced  the  number  of  these \nrequests  to  1  for  each.  This  reduced  the  load  time,  memory  usage  and  network  bandwidth \nrequirement to a minimum.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): IDE - VScode \nLanguage - TypeScript \nBrowser - Chrome, Mozilla, IE \n \n\n289 \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: Adding  Google  Cloud  Platform  (GCP)  support  for  Cloud  Snapshot \nManager  and  refactoring  the  dashboard to  use  new  Preact  based  components  replacing  older \nversion in angular. \nMajor learning outcomes: Worked on code -  \n1.  Production  ready  code  is  highly  modular  in  design  and  structure.  This  is  required  for  good \nreadability  and  modifiability  of  code  in  future.  Team  members  working  on  the  same  code  can \neasily understand the purpose and internal functioning of snippets.  \n2. For UI,  the HTML elements are wrapped inside custom components which makes it easy for \nre-use and modification to suit the context.  \n3.  The  JS  version  used  (typescript) is  open-source  making  it easy  to  use.  There  is  a  strict \nimposition of data structure on the objects used thus ensuring that only correct data formats are \nused. \n4. The application brings under its control almost all possible use cases to make sure none of \nthe conditions are unhandled when application is in use by the customer. \n5.  Comments  are  extremely  important  to  help  understand  input/expected  output  of  code \nsnippets. Applications usually  live for 10-12 years which requires proper transfer of knowledge \nfrom current to future team members.  \n6.  Coding  conventions  developed  should  be  strictly  followed.  This  make  it  easy  for  other \nmembers to understand the semantics of variable names and function prototypes. Terminology \nrelated to product is easily understood making development faster and testing easier. \nWorked as a team member - \n1.  Ask  for  help  and  be  ready  to  help  any  time.  Mistakes  are  unavoidable  but  learning  and \nimprovement are most important. \n2. Time management is very important. Delaying work can cause problems as time might not be \navailable later. \n3. Conceptual understand of project is required before we start coding.  \n4. Keeping the data safe is very important. Many times machines failed during the development \nand data was lost. Commiting any work done to remote repository is important. \n5. Taking breaks from work can lead to relaxed mind and increases productivity. This also helps \nto come up with solutions to problems. \n6.  Look  for  solutions  on  internet.  Ask  team  members  and  proceed.  Also  remember,  they  are \nalso busy. Respect each ones time and work. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n\n290 \n \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Organization of \nTeam - Two distinct groups of people for - Front End, Back End. \nInitially, a small assignment was given to bring familiarity with the tools used for the project. This \nhelped me to understand what is expected of the project on a bigger scale.Teams were highly \nengaged with each other as in scrum process. Free flow of ideas among all members including \nthe   higher  management   concerned  with  the  project.  Weekly   meetings   ensured   work   is \nprogressing in desired direction with good amount of work done. Challenges when encountered \nwere resolved with help from members. Some were simple but some took around a weeks time \nto  get  resolved.  Manager  understood  the  challenges  as  we  are  working  from  home  and  its \ndifficult  to  get  other  person  immediately  online.  Sufficient  time  was  given  to  understand  the \nproject.  They  were  considerate  enough  to  change the  schedule  for  demo  of  project  when  I \nrequired some  other  urgent  work.The  technical  lead  was  very  helpful  and  open  for  any  doubt \nsession. Sometimes he even showed me the line number and function name that needs to be \ncalled. At other times, he would give me time to study the code and understand the concept and \ntools used on my own.   \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Research Practice - extremely helpful. \nNetworking - making api calls to remote hosts."

My  major  projects  were - (A) Project – \nFramework for measuring Impact, adoption, and efficiency e-Gov's open source platform DIGIT, \nhowever this was dropped after 1.5 months as it was already being done by other department. \n(B) Project – Operations Plan – Marketing and Communications 2021  \nAn  Operations  Plan – Marketing  &  Communications  2021  had  already  been  developed  and    I \nam  working  on  four  aspects  of  it  namely – Research  and  Advisory    Organization  (analyst \nrelations), ethnographic research – storytelling, publications, influencer marketing. This plan and \nactivities are all part of our Marketing drive 2021. \n1) Research and Advisory Organizations - Through firsthand research, I came up with a list of \nsuch  organizations,  this  is  part  of  the  analyst  mapping  part.  Next, I  started  working  on \nengagement. \n2) Ethnographic research - storytelling -   Stories are a universal language of sorts. I have done \nthe  background  research,  first  understanding  what  is  ethnography  and  ethnographic  research. \nThen developing a meticulous report of ethnographers in urban governance ecosystem. \n3)  Influencer  marketing - Influencers  are  the  one to  create  and  share  original  content  that \nresonates  well  with  our  brand  and  their  audience.  Influencers  can  help  signal  to  people  in  the \naudience that our work is important or interesting from a resource they already trust.  \n4) Media Outreach – Publications - Media outreach gives us the chance to pitch our content to \npeople/media outlets who have a platform to share it with a wider audience. It has no limitations \nand  might  revolve  around  the  press,  social  media  networks,  and  popular  blogs  around  the \nworld. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): My  project  was  more  about  researching  and \nengagement.

After  getting  a  basic  understanding  of  pricing  algorithms,  I  chose  a \nbusiness  case  to  work  on  i.e.  'Consumers  end  up  paying  more  due  to  high-frequency  pricing \nalgorithms.'  So,  the  goal  that  I  tried  to  achieve  here  was  to  develop  a  pricing  tool  for  the \nretailer/target  firm  to  monitor  weekly  prices  and  volume  for  everyday  grocery  items.  Through \nthis, they can select the algorithm that gives the 'maximum revenue' for their particular business \nstrategy, while also keeping 'consumer's interest' at hand. \nI chose 2 food items – ‘yogurt’ and ‘salsa’ and 1 beverage – ‘beer’ as our products for which we \nmade  weekly  price  recommendations,  estimated  the  weekly  demand,  and  calculated  the \ncorresponding  revenue  generated.The  algorithms  that  were  used  in  the  simulating  product \nprices were 'Thompson Sampling', 'Q-Learning' (Reinforcement learning techniques), and 'Joint \ndistribution-KDE' in python.Finally, I made a pricing tool on 'Power BI' for the retailer/target firm \nwhich helps them monitor Actual v/s Predicted (prices, volume, and revenue). \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Microsoft  Excel,  Python,  Jupyter-lab,  Spyder, \nMachine learning, Reinforcement learning, Power BI. \n \nObjectives of the project: Provide some improved gross revenue margin to the retailer/target \nfirm  on  everyday  grocery  items  like  yogurt,  salsa,  and  beer  through  the  use  of  pricing \nalgorithms, while creating a good consumer experience. \n \n\n323 \n \nMajor learning outcomes: Experience of working in a professional environment. \nImportance of effective communication, teamwork and efficient planning. \nApplication of technical concepts to live problems. \nI learnt how to own the task and work independently. \nHow meetings happen and deadlines are set. \nI got a chance to improve my interpersonal skills. \nI learnt Microsoft Excel, Python and ML,RL for data analysis and model building. \nI learnt Power BI for building reports, dashboards & interactive tools for data visualization. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: A White-Paper on 'Algorithmic Pricing in Retail Industry'. \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Mostly,  the \nwork  was  focused  on  New  Product Development - creating  a  dynamic  pricing  tool  that \ncompared  certain  algorithms  and  implements  the  best  one  in  that  business  case  scenario.For \nthe  initial  stages,  some  amount  of  research  is  required  to  understand  the  existing  literature \naround the project and thus, develop a unique solution solving the chosen business case. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: It  is  good  to  have  knowledge  of  Principles  of \nEconomics, Supply Chain Management, Machine Learning.

And  the \nother two projects were based on product sales forecast with various time series models using \nMS Excel and R programming. \nFor the first project, I identified a specific product category which was nutraceuticals. I selected \ndifferent brands of Biotin tablets and then I did the web scraping. So with web scrapping, I was \nable  to  gather   important   data  like  product   name,  ratings,   title  and  review.   I   used  the \nBeautifulSoup  library  of  python  to  carry  out  this  task  and  finally  exported  that  as CSV  file  and \ngot 500+ reviews for sentiment analysis. And then for the next step, I removed the punctuations, \nand  stop  words  and  cleaned  the data.  I  carried  out  text  pre-processing  and  for  that,  Natural \nLanguage  Toolkit  (or  NLTK),  a  platform  for  building  Python  programs  to  work  with  human \nlanguage  data,  was  used.

The first \nproject was on measurement and analysis of vibration on RTU during truck transportation. The \n\n396 \n \nobjective  of  this  project  was  to  get  the  vibration  characterstics  in  trucks  as  function  of  speed, \npayload,suspension  type,  road  type/condition.  Generally,  three  types  of  vibration  occur  on \ngoods  while  transportation (i.e.) lateral,  longitudinal,  vertical  vibration.  At  lower  frequency \nvertical vibration are significant as compared to lateral & longitudinal but at higher frequency all \nthree of them are equidistant. For better study random vibration were considered. \nThe  second  project  was to  develop  an  Excel  Macro  Code  for  determination  of  criticalspeed  of \nshaft  with  multiple  rotors  and  supports,  considering  all  forces  and  momentsaccounting  it.  The \ncritical speed of three rotor system are analysed with two boundary conditions (i.e.)two support \nand  three support.  The  critical  speed  analysis  is  carried  on  solidshaft  made  of  structural  steel \nhaving  density  of  7850kg/m3.  The  Excel  code  is  designed  insuch  a  way  that  it can  calculate \ncritical  speed  for  multiple  range  of  inputs.  It  is  observedthat,  the  critical  speeds  are  altered  by \nchanging  boundary  conditions.The  third  project  aims  to  develop  a  generalized  approach  in \nselecting  lugs  locations  of  RTU  so  that  the  forces  and  stress  at  lugs  are  equidistant  and \nminimal. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): ANSYS, MATLAB, EXCEL VBA, MINITAB. \n \nObjectives   of   the   project: 1)   Measurement   and   analysis   of   vibration   on   RTU   during \ntransportation 2)  Determination  of  critical  speed of  shaft  using  excel  macro 3)  Creating \ngeneralized algorithim for RTU lifting lug location. \n \nMajor  learning outcomes: Fast  Fourier  transform,  Power  Spectral  density,  DOE  analysis, \nExcel VBA modules. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Johnson \ncontrols  is  one  of  the  best  place  to  work  as  mechanical  engineer.

The  2  month  training  program  is  followed  by  a  1  month  KDU  (Kickdrum \nUniversity as they call their batch of interns) project in which the interns are assigned to different \n\n434 \n \nprojects.  Finally,  the  remaining  3  months, the  interns  are  provided  projects  based  on  their \nrequirements. \nThe 2 month training program consists of well planned out and informative regular sessions on \nthe  3  tracks  of  development  in  Kickdrum - Frontend  (React  JS,  HTML,  CSS  etc.),  Backend \n(Java,  Spring),  AWS.  The  training  program  concludes  with final  assignment  which  requires \ninterns to work in teams of 3 to build website based on the requirements provided. \nAfter the training, I had the opportunity to work on 2 POCs - first on a Kickdrum customer project \nand  the  other  for  mobile  app  development  using  Flutter.  I  worked  on  few  AWS  S3  file  backup \nscripts  for  another  project  as  well. Finally,  I  was  involved  in  migrating JIRA  project  from  one \ncloud instance to another with management team. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): AWS, React, HTML, CSS, Flutter, Node JS, Java \nSpring, UiPath automation. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  first  project  required  our  team  to  provide  a  POC  for  UiPath \nautomation testing tool. The tool had to be evaluated to be utilized by  Kickdrum customers for \nvalidating their complex airline scheduling interface. For the second project, we had to develop \na  template  mobile  application  interface  using  Flutter  framework, Dart  and  provide  detailed \nanalysis of the performance and limitations of the same.

				"writeUp": "Student Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : Project Work: My internship project is \"BLE Mesh \nFriend feature\" which is implemented in MATLAB using OOPS concepts. During the start of my \nproject, I learned about Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Mesh. In order \nto maintain the low power consumption of BLE, Bluetooth mesh introduced friend feature. Then, \nI read about friend feature at transport layer in \"Mesh Profile\" Bluetooth Specification v1.0.1. For \nlow  power  nodes  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which  receive  data  less  frequently, \nthe  amount  of  time  that  they  need  to  listen  is  limited  by  establishing  friendship  between  low \npower   nodes   and   friend   nodes.   Did   literature   survey   on   how   to   compute   the   energy \nconsumption  and  lifetime  of  low  power  nodes  in  Bluetooth  mesh  network.  The  functionality  of \nnodes  with  low  power  feature  and friend feature is  developed  at  the  transport  layer. The  timer \nfunctionality is developed to maintain the timers for low power node and friend node. The timer \nfunctionality  is  integrated  with  the  low  power  feature  and  friend  feature  functionality.  Normal \nBluetooth mesh node functionality is implemented in the transport layer in addition to low power \nand friend feature functionalities.  In this project, the average current consumption and lifetime \nof  Bluetooth  mesh  low  power  node  is  computed.  Also,  the  average  time  statistics  of  different \nBluetooth mesh nodes are compared, and it is observed that, low power node is in sleep state \nfor most of the time which results in more lifetime of the low power node.  \n\n250 \n \nOther Activities: Improved coding skills in MATLAB by doing Cody. Improved company needed \nskills by frequent interactions with the manager and mentor. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : S/w: MATLAB \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : Develop  friend  functionality  to  conserve  the  energy  of  Bluetooth \nmesh  low  power  node  like  temperature,  humidity  sensor  nodes  which receive  data  less \nfrequently.  The  energy  is  conserved  by  limiting  the  amount  of  time  that  the  low  power  nodes \nneed  to  listen. This  can be  achieved  by  establishing friendship  between  low  power  nodes  and \nfriend nodes. Once friendship is established, friend node stores messages that are addressed to \nthe  low  power  node  and  are  delivered  to  the  low  power  node  when  it  explicitly  requests  the \nfriend node. Also, friend node relays messages on behalf of low power node. \n \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes : Learned  new  concept called  Bluetooth  mesh  introduced  in \nBluetooth  5.0.  Learned  how  to  design  friend  functionality  and  its  timers  using  OOPS  in \nMATLAB. Learned about unit testing by testing the friend functionality at the transport layer and \nintegration  testing  by  testing  the friend  functionality  after  integration  with  other  layers  of  mesh \nsystem architecture. Learned about how devices are simulated in real-time. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : Working \nenvironment is peaceful and enthusiastic.

In  my  first  project,  I  was  in  a  team  and  our  objective  was  to \nautomatically verify the personal information given by the supplier and customer is right or not. \nFor this, we had to make an API to call the government website and take information from there. \nTo  do  so  we  had  to  bypass  a  captcha.  To  break  the  captcha  we  made  a  machine  learning \nmodel to do so. \nThe second one was to make a part of a web application to automatically make a graph of the \ncompany’s transaction to map the connectivity between  companies.  Since  oxyzo(a  subsidiary \ncompany  of  OfBusiness)  is  an  SME  financing  platform.  So,  to  give  loans  to  a  company  our \nprocessing team has to run a background check on the bank transaction of the company. This is \na tedious process and requires a lot of time. So, to move this faster my project was to make this \ngraph of the companies that are our customer or have a history of a certain type from that bank \ntransactions. \n \nTool  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w) : Spring  Mvc,  java,  neo4j,  react,  echarts,  python, \nkeras \n \nObjectives  of  the  project : To make  a  network of  companies to to make  the  loan processing \neasier \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : There were a lot of things that I learnt from working in OfBusiness. \nIt  includes  software  development,  how  to  work in  a  team,  how  to  manage  my  time  in  a  better \nway and lot other little things. \n \nDetails of Papers/patents :  \n \nBrief  Description  of working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company : The  working \nenvironment  of  the  company  was  very  friendly  and  supportive.

I was given a good project despite \nhaving virtually no experience in the field. And was helped whenever I needed it. My expectation \nfrom the company was to give a good project for me to learn the tricks and trade of the industry \nand  it  was  fulfilled.  So,  I  was  happy  to  work  in  OfBusiness  it  not  only  helped  me  to  learn \nsoftware development but also how to effectively work in a team and was fun to work here. \n \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project : Object  Oriented  Programming,  Database \nSystems, Data Structure and Algorithms"

The primary work was of writing the crawling code, which not \nonly  requires in  depth  knowledge  of  crawler  but  also  the  website  we  are  trying  to crawl,  the \nvarious  authentication  mechanism  used  by  it, various  HTTP  request  and  different  type  of \nsession that is maintained by server, all have to taken into account.

Also  sometimes, new  services  are  needed  that  we  need  to  develop  from \nscratch as no libraries are available or the tools are paid that get job done. So basically, I wrote \ncrawling code for 20-25 websites, as well as developed helper tools like HTMLtoPDF converter \nfor  conversions  of  HTML  to  properly  formatted  PDF's,  also  wrote  various  REST  api's  for \n\n588 \n \ndifferent  task's  required.Attended  workshops  on  new  technologies  and  improving  overall \ntechnical skills. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java 8, REDIS, S3,MongoDB. \n \nObjectives of the project: Contribute to the SPIDER project by writing crawling code of various \nwebsites, as well as improvements to the crawler and adding utilities and services. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: All this in-turn greatly improved my understanding of REST services \nand HTTP request, concurrent programming, use of producer and consumer, design patterns in \npractice, various deep learning concepts . \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NIL \n \nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The crawler is \nmost important to the organisation as it produces the required data, that is used by other teams \nlike  back-end,front-end,  to  maintain  their  websites, design  required  services  and provide  them \nalso, the contribution to the SPIDER project should  boost the productivity of the other teams, as \nwell  as  increase  the  amount  of  CORRECT  data  available  to  them,so  code  written  should  be \nsuch that full fill these tasks, so the PR's that we submit are rigorously tested, and attention to \ndetails  are  given,  so  as  to  not  Ingest  incorrect  data.

NOC  have  an  advantage  of  meeting  the  needs  like \nscalability, physical routing feasibility at the same time they don’t compromise on the speed. \nArchitectures today implement different open standard AMBA protocols as they help seamlessly \nintegrating peripherals from different vendors with the proprietary systems. To avoid re-spins in \nthe  design, VLSI  design  flow  demands  a  step  known  as  design  verification.  Design  cycle  of  a \nsemiconductor  chip  involves  thoroughly  verifying  its  functionality.  My  work  at  Qualcomm \n\n492 \n \ninvolved verifying the bus architectures of mobile system processors. To thoroughly verify all the \nfunctionality,  functional  coverage  in  enabled  wherein  we  create  different  test  scenarios  and \nprovide  different  stimulus  to  ensure  that  all  the  functionalities  are  covered  and  verified.  This \nprocess  help  in  catching  RTL  bugs  at  very  early  stage. Another  design  verification  metric  is \ntoggle  coverage  which  is  done  at  the  final  stage  of  the  design  cycle.  Toggle  coverage \nenablement  helps  in  catching  bugs  due  to  data  corruption  and  ports  being  tied  to  incorrect \nvalues which may not be caught during the functional verification. Another task included writing \nassertions  and  developing  checkers  to  verify  different  features  in  NOC.

				"writeUp": "Student write-up \n \nShort  summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: One  major  part  of the  work  I  had  undertaken  at \nUber involved  writing SQL queries to retrieve information from the Uber databases, which  was \nthen imported into and processed within dashboards created mainly through the use of Google \nsheets. Oftentimes,  I was also tasked with creating these Google dashboards to track a host of \nmetrics (such as total trips taken, trips per rider, gross bookings, number of promotion trip taken, \netc.)  for  new  market  regions  or  new  payment  partners.  I  also  had  the  chance  to  assist  with \nnumerous  ad-hoc  analyses  and  one-time  data  pulls  which  basically  required  me  to  query  out \nsome  data  from  the  database,  import  it  into  Google  sheets  and  then  use  sheets  formulae  to \ncondense that raw data into useful/readable metrics which were then organised and presented \nin  a  final  view.  Another  type  of  work  that  I  was  tasked  with  was  doing  BAU  (or  Business  as \nUsual) tasks, the most common of which involved updating existing dashboards with the latest \nweekly and monthly data at the start of a new week or month. In most cases, when a new query \nneeded  to  be  written,  I was  usually  provided  with  an  existing  query  that  retrieved  similar  data, \nand would just edit that query as per my own needs and requirements. As such, writing queries \nfrom absolute scratch was quite uncommon. \n \n\n736 \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): There was a wide range of tools that I used over \nthe  course  of  my  work  at  Uber,  however  most  of  those  tools  were  internal  tools,  exclusive  to \nUber such as Querybuilder, so I had to learn how to use them from the ground. \n \nObjectives  of  the  project: As  there  was  no  single  \"project\"  that  I  was  assigned,  most  of the \nwork I did involved assisting more senior analysts with their work, or completing tasks that I was \ndirectly assigned by managers/team leads. So, some of the \"objectives\" of the numerous tasks \nand  projects  I  worked  on  included:  setting  up  new  dashboards;  performing  post-promotional \ncampaign data analyses to quantify how well a promotion performed; cleaning up and updating \nan onboarding document that is shared with all new Uber joinees; and automating queries used \nby large projects to eliminate the need to manually run them, amongst other things. \n \nMajor learning outcomes: The major learning outcomes I gained were:  \n- Writing and optimisation of SQL queries. \n-Creation, updation and maintenance of Dashboards on Google Sheets \n- Usage of Google sheets formulae to process raw data into readable/useful metrics. \n- Automation of queries through the use of the internal uWorc tool. \n- Creation of custom database tables with the Kirby internal tool. \n-Cross-team communication when working on large multi-team projects. \n- Time-management/organisational skills, required to keep up the flow of continuous tasks and \nprojects. \n- Ability to quickly identify and find necessary database tables through the Databook internal tool \n- Communication  skills,  required  when  presenting  the results  of  your  work  to  the  associated \nstakeholders. \n \nDetails of papers/patents: NA \n \nBrief  description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  working \nenvironment at Uber is a very dynamic and fast-paced one where you will recieve new work and \ntasks on daily basis. Despite this, your team members and other analysts are very friendly and \nsupportive and will be happy to help you out. Due to the organisations emphasis on \"ownership\" \nof work, you will not only have to finish the work/tasks assigned to you, but will also be expected \nto maintain and update any and all dashboards, documents and queries you create during your \ntime  at  Uber.  Also,  even  though  you  will  have  a  mentor  and  be  part  of  a  larger  team,  most \n\n737 \n \nanalysts work on their tasks alone, and usually only reach out to others for help/assistance. The \nsame  is  true  of  interns  and  you  will  most  likely  be  the  only  one  working  on  a  specific \ntask/project.  In  terms  of  work  deadlines,  they  aren't  very  strict,  and  you'll  usually  just  have  to \nfinish  your  work  as  soon  as  possible,  or  within  the  stipulated  time  that  your  stakeholder \nmentions. You will also have a lot of freedom to meet and interact with people from other teams, \nas oftentimes, the most well-qualified person to resolve your doubts may not be from your own \nteam. Furthermore, since everyone in the organisation uses either Google Hangouts or Slack, it \nisn't difficult to communicate with others, despite the limitations of WFH. \n \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Unfortunately,   due   to   my   background   in \nMechanical  Engineering,  none  of  the  academic  courses  I  had  completed  were  relevant  to  the \nwork and projects I contributed to at Uber."
