Two of them were steel structures, one Reinforced Concrete \nstructure and one composite structure. For all of these structures, I was the \nindependent structural engineer. I was responsible for delivering the structural design \nreport, structural drawings and fabrication drawings within the deadline. There were \ncertain challenges unique to each project and it was huge learning opportunity, \nworking on each of them. The steel structure had a Steel truss for it's roof and \nprocess of the design of the truss was a brilliant space to give way to your innovation \nand creativity as an engineer. The composite structure was an entirely new concept \nhaving steel members and an in-casing of RCC. The concrete structure, though only \na G+2 structure, was located in Earthquake zone V, for which extensive dynamic \ncomputations had to be performed using response spectrum analysis, incorporating \nthe effect of vertical ground motion.

Which means that they continuously assign you projects, of \nwhich you are the independent structural engineer and along with an architect, you \nhave to complete the design and the drawings within the deadline. But the work \nculture is below average to say the least. Medium of conversation is majorly Marathi, \nyou have to work 6 days a week and with the deadlines closing in, you'll have to stay \nback as long as it takes. So, I have had to sit through two hour long conferences, \nstaring blankly at faces because everyone was speaking in Marathi. But again, the \nVP of the department is an absolute genius and the smallest of the discussions that I \ncould have with him (because he stays occupied mostly), were very enlightening(with \nrespect to structural engineering). So, the company doesn't provide much of an \nexperience on grounds of professionalism and people skills, but regarding \nengineering stuff, it's a good place to be.  \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Mechanics of Solids, Analysis of \nStructures, Design of Steel Structures, Design of Concrete Structures \n \n                                                                   \n \n "

Securities lending or stock \nlending refers to  the  lending  of securities by  one  party  to another. The  terms  of  \nthe  loan  will  be  governed  by  a  \"Securities  Lending  Agreement which requires \nthat the borrower provides the lender with collateral, in the form of cash or non-cash \nsecurities, of value equal to or greater than the loaned securities plus agreed upon \nmargin. Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, \npension plans and other large investment portfolios. Most securities loans are \ncollateralized, either with other securities or with cash deposits. Where lenders take \nsecurities as collateral, they are paid a fee by the borrower. By contrast, where they \nare given cash as collateral, they pay the borrower interest but at a rate (the rebate \nrate) that is lower than market rates, so that they can reinvest the cash and make a \nreturn. Pricing is negotiated between the parties and would typically take into account \nfactors such as supply and demand for the particular securities, collateral flexibility, \nthe size of any manufactured dividend and the likelihood of the lender recalling the \nsecurities early. As well as securities lending, sale and repurchase (repo) and buy-\nsell back transactions are  used  for  the  temporary  transfer  of  securities  against  \ncash.

The components being: \n• Back testing \n• Robustness \n• Sensitivity to Key Model Assumptions \n• Representativeness \n \n\n    \n \n  \n92|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nThe model determines the extent up to which Credit Suisse can hold up the capital \nrequirements to absorb the economic shocks and lot of defaults happen. The PDs, \nupgrade rate, downgrade rate, migrations etc. gives the idea about the performance \nof the counter-parties and, hence the requirement of the bank accordingly. \n \nBefore going further into the monitoring, first it is very important to give a glance \nabout the model itself. It is very important to understand the model to do its \nmonitoring and then do some methodological experiments. The basic understanding \nof the model is required to do the mentioned above. The essence of the model is the \none parameter representation of credit ratings transition matrices. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : R Studio, MS Excel \n \nObjectives of the project  : Statistical Monitoring & Methodological Analysis of \nProbability of Defaults Model \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Mathematical & Statistical Modelling  \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Prob & Stats, Econometrics \n "

After the 2008 financial crisis, BASEL committee of \nBanking devised the framework for the In-house assessment of the processes and it \nwas made compulsory for he firms to conduct in-house assessment for their process. \nThis assessment are shared with the regulators quarterly and are reviewed by the \nsenior managers/Chief Operating Officers (COOs) in different frequency intervals in \nthe forums like BRCMs(Business risk controls meetings) and GMCC (Global Market \nControl Committee). The projects in GM Controls revolve around the Reporting tools \nand Dashboards to ensure the business is compliant and also informed of the errors \noccurring during the duration of assessment. The Key Risk Indicators (KRI) have \nbeen defined on the basis of the process to monitor the risk occurring due to People, \nProcess or System.  These KRI are also called Metrics for daily Processing. In \nGovernance & Reporting, These KRI’s are reported in various platforms depending \non the Risk of the Business. The details of few key projects are as follow: \n1) Governance MI – A group of 36 metrics have been determined and agreed by the \nbusinesses to reflect the Operation Risk of the Business. These metrics are divided \ninto 4 different pillars- Conduct, Operations, Behaviour and Control Environment. \nGovernance MI is reported monthly. The data for this MI is sourced from various \nsources. It is then analysed and Reconciled into a dashboard which give a complete \nview of the Metrics for particular Business for the Month of analysis. This MI is \nreflected in all the Business specific BRCMs and the group level GMCC. Governance \nMI gives the Month-on-Month view for the metrics and the RAG status for the same, \nRe for the Breach, Amber for nearing Breach and Green for being in control. These \nRAG is determined based on pre-defined thresholds which are changed half Yearly \non 12 months moving average. \n \n2) APAC DASHBOARD – It is a group specific dashboard where all the Metrics \nassociated with the Asia Pacific group are reported in single window. This is an \nextensive dashboard consisting of 142 BRCM Metrics and 111 ORCC metrics. This \ngives a trend view for all the metrics for all the APAC business, being able to view \nthree months view in the dashboard. Also giving the RAG for the metrics similar to \nGovernance MI.  \n \n3) BRCMs and GMCC  – The performance of a business is analysed and monitored \nmonthly, and discussed in these monthly meetings. These Business Risk Controls \nmeetings are organised by the Business COOs to discuss business performance. All \nthe aspects of business are discussed in these meetings to insure that the business \nis running smooth, and to rectify all misdoings that has happened/ might occur. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Microsoft Excel \n \nObjectives of the project  : Monthly assessment and Report generation for \nBusiness Operation Risk \n\n    \n \n  \n94|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Networking is very important and Importance of \nOperation Risk \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Quality Control Assurance & \nReliability \n "

(The overrides are a list of \ncomplex trades of certain counter-parties whose exposure profiles through the usual \ncalculation procedure do not reflect the true economic value; hence manual \ncalculation is done). This is achieved by splitting the PE by taking into consideration \nthe Mark to Market (MtM) and Standardised Approach - Counterparty Credit Risk \n(SA-CCR) Potential Future Exposure (PFE) numbers. The business outcome of this \nassignment was that it saved around 6 business hours monthly. Also the control \nchecks put in place ensured that operational errors are registered and rectified.  \n \nThe second assignment involved automating the exposure calculation process \ninvolved in maintaining a specific override. The process involved calculation of \nExposure Exposure (EE) and Potential Exposure (PE) by the shortcut formula. It also \ninvolves Calibration of Inflation, Interest Rate and Mortality Rate for PE and EE VaR \ncalculation which is used in PE and EE calculation. Additionally sourcing of Inflation \nand Interest Rate sensitivities for PE and EE VaR calculation was also done.  \n \nThe third assignment involved building a tool for control check of PE and EE profiles \nfor Overrides. It basically compares the PE and EE profiles of the overridden \ncounterparties of two environments to register any mismatch and to ensure whether \nthey are due to overriding of profiles by override owner or due to improper flow of PE \nand EE profiles. \nprofile. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Excel, VBA, SQL, Internal \nSoftware's/Applications. \n \nObjectives of the project  : Exposure Calculation Methodology \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The BAU of my team was to generate Potential \nExposure, PE and Expected Exposure, EE numbers, both unstressed and stressed \nfor the front office (FO).

These \npast 5 months have flown by and I will not forget the lessons I learnt here. I interned \nin the Operations Division of the firm, in the Securitized Products Services team. In \nthe beginning, I was unsure about how to carry myself in a corporate environment, \nthat too in a corporate giant such as Goldman Sachs. The first few weeks I spent \nobserving carefully my team, how they carry themselves and commit to their work. It \ndidn’t take as long as I expected to blend into the corporate environment. The \nGoldman experience helped me understand how the corporate world looks and \nworks like.  \nIt helped me apply my technical knowledge to practical scenarios, transitioning from \nlearning in college to application in the firm. This was my first internship where my \n\n    \n \n  \n152|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nwork had an important role to play in the day-to-day performance of the team. The \nlearning curve for the first few weeks was very steep and I was trained on the day to \nday function of the team. I had to make sure that all the legal documents needed for \na trade to happen are in on time and they have been approved by the reviewing \nteams. I also had to ensure that all the trades are executed on time according to \ndifferent deadlines of different markets and correctly. In addition I had to make \njournal entries for different invoices. Then I started working on my project in addition \nto day-to-day functions. That helped me learn about how the trader commission \naccount is maintained and how we maintain a journal of different transactions. There \nwere no special skills required to the job except for a very basic know-how of Excel. \nHowever, it is pretty helpful to do a few finance courses as it just improves the \nunderstanding of what the team is doing and how it relates to the industry as a whole. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Excel, Visual Basic for \nApplications, SQL \n \nObjectives of the project  : To find and understand the breaks in trader \ncommission account, caused by incorrect timing or amount of debit/ credit and create \nan automated tracker that identifies the breaks, reconciles all the reports and help \nresolve that break which will save a lot of time of team which can be utilized for other \ncritical tasks. It aims to improve efficiency and save time. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : I gained a significant amount of knowledge \nregarding the international market and trading world from my team.  \nThe project gave an insight of how the trader commission account works and how the \nsettlements are done and how the data flows from different systems. It also gave me \nan in-depth knowledge of how books and records are maintained, how the breaks are \ncaptured and resolved and how an automated tracker is created. \nI also learnt about data warehousing, data visualisation and analytical reporting tools \nthrough Data School sessions conducted by Goldman Sachs. My knowledge and \ninterest in the financial sector has risen along with the development of soft-skills that \nare essential in the modern office space. I also learnt how to manage my time and \nplan ahead to meet deadlines.  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : I have observed how my team covers for others when someone is on \nleave, which reinforces the importance of teamwork in the success of any \norganization. The essentialism displayed by my team when it comes to \ncommunication as well as handling issues is surely something which I have imbibed \nduring the course of my internship. Also, the humility displayed by the Vice \nPresidents and Group Leaders has left a deep impact on me. I look up to these \npeople and strive to achieve excellence in every walk of life. A rise in patience, \ndetermination and the ability to work hard are the key takeaways from this internship. \nI also learnt the value of cultivating professional relationships. In today’s world it is \nnot just enough to do exemplary work but networking is also required to excel as a \nprofessional. In all, it has been an enriching experience and I am thankful to PS-2 for \ngiving me the opportunity to work with Goldman Sachs. \n \n\n    \n \n  \n153|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Fundamentals of Finance and \nAccounting, Derivatives and Risk Management, Financial Management, Financial \nEngineering \n "

AI OpenScale allows \nbusinesses to operate and automate AI at scale – irrespective of how the AI was built \nand where it runs. This service provides enterprises visibility into how AI is built, \nused, and performs thus proving to be a major breakthrough in the field of Machine \nLearning by serving as the solution for the issues of \"explainability, bias detection, \nand remediation\". I was initially assigned the work of verification of some of the \nfeatures and regression testing to get comfortable with the already existing code and \nfeatures. The work included testing whether a variety of datasets comprised of varied \ndata types, were biased or unbiased using the data bias calculation service, testing a \nvariety of models such as SVM, Tensorflow, Keras on top of Tensorflow built using \nframeworks such as Scikit-Learn, using the model the model bias calculation service.  \nThen I was assigned to work on implementing logging across all the functions using a \ncustom logger which had to store additional information apart from logging the \nerrors/warnings. I was assigned the task of improving the service's performance by \nmaking use of a local cache. Later, I worked on implementing RESTful API for \ncommunication across the sub-services.

I was required to develop models \nleveraging concepts of Assembly Line used in engineering and designing a map for \nvarious applications used in the firm to optimize the complete processing of data. \nStrategic implementation of various methods to deduce a basic code for transforming \na general process into an application comprised of my initial project which gradually \nshaped into a Global task involving teams from various parts of the country and \nbecame a core of Project Management. In a nut shell, it was a combination of \nTechnology and Management. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Microsoft Excel, Microsoft \n\n    \n \n  \n241|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nPowerpoint (Extensive use), Company licensed softwares  \n \nObjectives of the project  : To Identify potential Automation opportunities and \ndetermine the optimum solution (Strategic/Robotics) minimizing the time required and \nmaximizing the return on Investments \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Robust Governance Models, Teamwork, Project \nManagement, Automation on tools, Global Communication, Networking, Stakeholder \nManagement \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : The expectation is to learn and practice on whatever task is being \nassigned to you as a training exercise in the initial one month. Thereafter, the person \nneeds to understand the dynamics of the organization i.e. (s)he needs to be vigilant \nof what is happening in a particular project of the team and in the organization as a \nwhole. (S)he needs to understand the system and curriculum being very particular \nabout the communication and accountability. (S)he must be aware of the impact any \nword said by him/her can create henceforth. It will be easy to get comfortable with \nwhatever technical tools are in the space but, keeping track of everything as a project \nmanager is where the real test will begin. All in all, being in the project management \nneeds you to be on your toes every moment, keeping track of the projects, \nsuggesting ways to clear the road blocks pertaining to a project and finding optimum \nsolutions even while coding being from an engineering background. It is a complete \npackage of an overall and brilliant learning experience. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Financial Management (Excel \nExercises), Financial Risk Analytics and Management (Excel Problems) \n "

This \nfeature requires a smartphone to simultaneously act as both Wi-Fi Station and \nAccess Point. Wi-Fi sharing involves routing of traffic at the IP protocol. As the IP \nlayer is present in the Application processor, such traffic gets routed from the \nApplication processor. The purpose of this project is to offload such traffic from the \nApplication Processor to the Wi-Fi chip during Wi-Fi sharing; whenever there is no \nconsiderable user activity. This helps the Application processor to go to the low \npower mode and the connectivity processor will handle the routing of data between \nconnected Wi-Fi clients and the internet.  \n \n\n    \n \n  \n376|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  :  Eclipse, Android Debug Bridge \n(adb), Wireshark \n \nObjectives of the project  :  To exclude Application processor as a functional \nentity for internet access in the Wi-Fi subnet (when Wi-Fi sharing feature is being \nused). This helps in lowering power consumption. The trigger for offload is the \nabsence of user activity on the device. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Revision and strengthening of technical knowledge. \nLearning the approach to be followed towards a technical project. Expanding coding \nskills. Exposure to professional world. Interactions with the experts in the field.

Making the current layout of the area on \nAutoCAD and proposing new ones to reduce the current commotion and man-\nmaterial movements, and hence removing the bottlenecks. \nI worked on my 2nd major project of Kitting Store Shifting. So there was a lot of cross \nmovement when it came to Trim Line 2 and 3. The whole objective was to relocate \nthe stores (zone wise) and pull the sub-assemblies to the area between the 2 lines so \nas to improve supervision and communication with the production team. A lot of data \ncollection was involved in this project, post which the new layouts were proposed and \nthe implementation of the same took place during the Diwali holidays. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : AutoCAD , MS-Excel \n \nObjectives of the project  :  Propose a new Kitting Store layout for Trim Line 2 \nand 3 area. The project had multiple objectives; firstly to reduce the distance moved \nby kitting trolleys from the Kitting Stores to the feeding station, secondly to segregate \nthe sub-assemblies from the Kitting Stores and relocating them at an appropriate \nplace and thirdly to ensure that only moving parts are being stored in the Kitting \nStore. At present the Kitting Center besides line 2 caters to cabs of both Trim Line 2 \nand Trim Line 3 whereas Kitting Center beside Trim Line 3 caters to cowls of Trim \nLine 2. There’s a lot of unnecessary movement of man and materials in this case. \nThe objective was to shift the contents of the kitting centers in a planned and phased \nmanner.  \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The learning outcomes were immense, specifically \nhow organisations of such large a stature work at the ground level, the inter-\ndepartmental dependence involved in its working. Coming to the project, I learnt to \nlearn about Logistics management - how it is the most important pillar of a \nmanufacturing industry. Being in the Planning Department, I had to communicate to a \nlot of people from other departments which even helped me to up the confidence in \nme which was lacking before. \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : The working environment is quite conducive.

The first use case includes the Proof of Existence which is an API designed to \nprove the existence of a document or a string in a private blockchain so as to prove \nthe rightful ownership of the document based on a timestamp and block number. The \nsecond use case deals with the telecom industry by preventing the usage of stolen \nphones by making sure they cannot register to mobile network  \nproviders. The third use case can be used to solve the common fraud found in the \nfinance industry which involves invoice financing. Various technologies and \ndatabases have been used which are listed below. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Docker, MongoDB, Ethereum, \nMySQL, Truffle, Ganache, Android Studio, Expo \n \nObjectives of the project  : Proving the existence of data at a certain point in \ntime can be very useful for  educators, entrepreneurs, and attorneys. Timestamping \ndata in an unalterable state  while maintaining confidentiality is perfect for legal \napplications. The Proof of  Existence project is based on the concept about proving \nthe ownership of a certain  document/file/media which was created on a date and \ntime. The Proof of Existence API allows the  users to store the hash of data securely \nwithin the Ethereum Blockchain so that in  future no claims can be raised regarding \nthe ownership of the data.

This API aims at preventing the usage of stolen phones by \nmaking sure it cannot be  registered to any network provider or even if they do try to \nregister with a stolen  phone, the location of the phone is found. The 3rd API is the \ntrade finance API which is used to prevent fraud in invoice financing. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learnt Blockchain concepts, Server side coding, \nDatabase Management, UI development, Team work, Communication \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Computer Programming \n "

We developed a \ndecentralised databse of blacklisted numbers so that no carrier in any region of world \n(if in consensus) will provide service to that phone. \nOther project I took up single handedly was developing an Alexa enabled feedback \nResponse app using amazon's services for buiding voive front-end and AWS lambda \nand DynamoDB. It was completed in 3 days and taught me how to take a boiler plate \ncode and turn it into a useful app overnight. Also it taught me how to take design \ndecisions. This was one of the most challenging tasks i completed which build my \nconfidence. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Blockchain Team: Ethereum \n[Solidity to code Smart contracts], NodeJs to write API's in backend, React Native \n(front-end), Docker (Containerisation), Linux, AWS to host/deploy (EC2 Ubuntu \ninstance), Web3 Module, Infura service (Replaced Geth - local node), GitLab - for \nVersion Control \nAlexa: Amazon developer console, AWS Lambda (NodeJs), AWS DynamoDB \n \nObjectives of the project  : To leverage properties of blockchain like Immutabiltiy \nand Decentralised Nature \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Mostly there are philosophical learnings to adapt to \ntech world rather than merely getting hands on with tech stack provided, as it's the \nmajor difference between a student and an employee. How to dive in completely new \ntechnology and create deliverable out of it filtering just the necessary stuff to speed \nup the process, simultaneously spending weekends to read for diving into depths to \ninnovate.  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : This company has one of the best campuses (office) in country. The \nplace (Trivandrum) is really peaceful which gives Bitsians the necessary reboot they \n\n    \n \n  \n443|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nneed which is not possible in crowded and polluted cities where other IT hubs are \nformed like bangalore/hyderabad/Gurgaon etc. \n Coming to work culture, working in an MNC teaches us a lot of things which are \nwere organised in an extremely efficient and interesting way. Mentors are one of the \ngreatest teachers I've ever had to brought in a lot of ideas which I might not even \nhave imagined. They listen to you and appreciate you. There's a lot of flexibility in \nterms of projects which you want to use. The best part is that they are using the \nlatest technologies which I going to be greatly useful in our careers. This place hosts \nplenty of technical, cultural events to stimulate our creativity and impose liveliness in \nemployees. This place is heaven for a nature lover who is a technology freak as well! \nJust to add to it: I got my job off-campus solely on the basis of projects done here, \nwhich saved my time from competing in on-campus placements and landing into \ndifferent projects which I might not like. I got an opportunity as a blockchain \ndeveloper at a decent pay. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Cryptography (Only if you want to \nunderstand the research part), Object oriented Programming, Data Structures and \nAlgorithms (minimally used), C programming \n "
