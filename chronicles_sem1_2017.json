Process behavior in the \naluminum smelting  industry  is  typically  highly  dynamic  and  unstable  and  involves  non-linear,  highly \ndimensional  relationships  among  process  parameters.  Therefore,  a  control  algorithm  is  required  to \nstabilize the performance of the reduction cell. Therein lies the importance of avoiding or reducing the \nharmful effects by taking appropriate actions early enough, in the view of various time lags such as the \ndelay caused by the time required to dissolve the alumina into the bath. Time series predictive modeling \nis  the  one  of  the  method  to  control  the  anode  effects.  We  can  maintain  the  required  alumina \npercentage in the bath.

It  provides  monitoring  and  management  of  cloud  application.  Autodesk's  Fusion360  Team \nproduct  has  basic  NewRelic  integration  helping  to  do  health  monitoring.  My  project  was  aimed  to \ncapture  more  functional  and  non-functional analytical  data  and  publish  to NewRelic,  as  new  metrics. \nThese  metrics  can  help  in  bringing  in-depth  visibility  of  the  product's  health,  user  behavior,  detect \nanomalies  and perform real-time diagnostics.

It  can  monitor  it's \nbackground  jobs  that  are  significant  part  of  the  application.  They  have  more  information  related  to  a \nrequest  to  debug  the  issue  helping  them  relating  the  request  in  multiple  monitoring  tools  and  desired \ncustom metrics from database regarding their offline jobs to monitor the health of their webapp. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The experience at Autodesk is one that has proved to be more practical than \nanything else taught academically. It has been brilliantly enlightening in the sense that any student who \nwishes  to  experience  the  real  application  of  his/her  learning  during  his/her  career  can  do  that  on  the \nPractice  School  2.  It  can  be specially  helpful  to  those  who  wish  to  decide  on  a  career  path  by  getting \nactual experience.

The technologies include Spring Framework, \nGradle and Ant, Design Patterns, Database Transactions, major modelling techniques etc. , which are not \nusually taught in the academic syllabus.

The  Wg  ligand  in  Drosophila  interacts  with  its \nsignaling  receptors  Frizzled  and  co-receptor  Arrow  and  binding  receptor  Dally  and  Dlp  resulting  in  an \nactivated  signaling  response.  The  key  player  in  this  signal  transduction  is  the  transcriptional  activator \nbeta-catenin  (Armadillo  in  Drosophila)  whose  cytoplasmic levels  increase  when  Wingless  signaling  is \nactive. For this purpose, we cultured S2 pTub Wg cells expressing Wg ligand, to obtain Wg conditioned \nmedia  which  will  then  be  purified.  We  made  efforts  to  develope  constructs  expressing  Wg  GFP,  Wg \nSNAP  and Dfz2 GFP to visualize  the said proteins under the microscope  and to measure  the respective \nconcentrations.    Immunostaining  and  Western    blot    assays    were    performed    to    understand  the \nArmadillo  protein  accumulation  in  S2R+cells  exposed    to  different  conditions  resulting    in    signaling  \nactivation, as well to check for the presence of Wg upon subjection to various steps for purification. The \nexpectation was to propose a model explaining the change in signaling readout observed on treatment \nof S2R+  cells with different quantities of ligand as well receptor expressed with respect to time. \nTools used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): I  used  tools  like  SnapGene  to  design  plasmids,  Western \nBlots to understand signaling, microscopy for visualization of fluorophores, Imagej for image analysis. \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  main  objectives  were  1) purifications  of  Wg  protein  2) expression  of \ntagged  ligand  and  receptor  3)  understanding  the  role  of  endocytosis  over  plasma  membrane  in  Wg \nsignaling  pathway  4) propose  a  model  for  understanding  the  change  in  signaling  with  change  in \nconcentration of ligand and receptor \nOutcomes of the project: 1) I was able to standardize the protocol for Wg protein purification \n2) Design an improved way to isolate Wg protein \n3) Development of the Wg GFP expressing construct. \n\nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: This  project  was  extremely  useful  in    practical  application  of  classroom \nknowledge.

It  receives  sensory  inputs  and  motor  commands,  and  act  as  an  integrator  to  fine  tune \nmotor  pattern.  Zebrafish  serves  as  an  excellent  model  organism  to  understand  the  cerebellar  circuitry \nand  its  functioning,  primarily  due  to  its  easy  accessibility  and  conserved cerebellar  layered  structure \nfrom  fish  to  mammals.  Purkinje  neurons  in  the  cerebellum  play  a  key  role  in  modulating  the  outputs \nfrom the cerebellum. They exhibit bistabilty in vivo and in vitro. Presence of two stable  states has also \nbeen  identified  in  the  zebrafish.  They  form  their  inhibitory  synapses  on  eurydendroid  cells,  which \nconstitute  the  major output  of  the  zebrafish  cerebellum.  How  the  activity  pattern  of  the  eurydendroid \ncells  is  affected  due  to  the  presence  of  Purkinje  neurons  in  either  states  is  not  known.  Many  Purkinje \nneurons converge on single eurydendroid cell, making it difficult to study the eurydendroid cell response \ndue    to    single    Purkinje    activity    through    direct    electrophysiology.    To    overcome    this,    CA8-\ncfos:ChR2(H134R)-mcherry plasmid was constructed to optogenetically activate a population of Purkinje \nneurons.  CA8,  a  Purkinje  neuron  specific  promoter  along  with  cfos  enhancer  element  was  cloned \nupstream  of  channelrhodopsin  protein.  Channelrhodopsin  is  a  mixed  cation  permeable  channel  which \ngets activated on stimulation of light. This protein was fused with mcherry fluorescent tag. The plasmid \nexpression was verified in the Purkinje neurons of the zebrafish. This constructed plasmid will facilitate \n\nstudying the effect of Purkinje neuronal states on eurydendroid cells by employing electrophysiological \ntechniques   and   optogenetics,   and   thereby   assist   in   understanding   how   the   Purkinje   and   the \neurydendroid cells together shape the output of the cerebellum. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Electrophysiology \nMicroinjection \nOptogentics \nObjectives of the project: Construction of CA8:ChR2-mcherry plamid.

Initially I have given some \nppts so that I can go through them and understand how everything works in maintenance department. \nMy project consists of three different phases, each one of them further divided into small steps and the \noutcome  of  the  project  is  to  improve  the  key  performance  indicators  of  all  A  class  machines  and  pilot \nchannel. I worked as a bridge between the project and my mentor and helped him in each phase and in \neach step in the best possible way. I used to collect all the data for KPI's  month wise from the software \nused by maintenance department and analyze it. In the end we calculated the overall improvement in all \nsix  month  and  tried  to  analyze  it.  During  my  internship  I  got  certification  for  lean  six  sigma  white  belt. \nApart  from  the  project  i  have  done  small  projects  on  various  channels  and  under  different  mentors \nwhich  proved  to  be  a very  good  learning  experience. we  used  to  take  trials  of  125  or  150  bearings  on \ndifferent  channels  to  find out  the  capability  of  machines. we  worked  on  a  Ovality  project  aimed  to \nreduce  down  the  ovality  as  required  by  the  customers  so  we  took  200  readings  after  heat  treatment, \nrough grinding and finish grinding to find out which process causes the ovality problem. For auto pairing \n\nmachine we wanted to figure out the effect of different parameters on friction torque so three different \ntimes we took 125 readings of standout for both cup and cone and tried to develop a relation between \nfriction torque and other parameters. Under Mohan Pandit sir we performed zero lost study on one of \nthe  channels  and  calculated  First  Time  Yield  (FYI)  and  Roll Time  yield  (RTY). In  the  end  I presented  my \nproject to company and my PS faculty and got the certification. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): CMMS, FTM, Minitab, MS Word \nObjectives  of  the  project: 30%  improvement  in KPI's of  all  A  class macj=hines  and  pilot  channel.  spare \nparts optimization. Maintenance cost reduction. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: After  the  implementation  of  the  second  phase  of  SPS  we  have  got  desired \nresults  but  still there  are  some  fluctuation  in  some  of  the  machines'  KPI  which will  be  reduce  down to \nachieve the target result with the help of third phase which is a continuous improvement phase. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: There is a lot to learn in this organization. During my project I learnt how to \nhandle data and how to analyze it. I learnt the software CMMS and FTM which is used by maintenance \ndepartment to extract data. \nDuring process capability analyses we got familiar to Minitab. \nGained a basic knowledge of lean six sigma and got white belt. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: T This  company  carries  a \nvery big brand name and working environment also matches that level. \nThe conversation gap between different department in this company doesn™t exist here. \nThe best thing which I like about the working culture in this organization is that you are not restricted to \nonly  your  project  mentor, anybody  can  ask  you  for  help  and  there  comes  the  chance  to  enhance  your \nlearning \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: This  project  related  to  the  professional  work  of  the  host \norigination so mostly it is irrelevant to the academic courses. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

However,  this  is  a  very  difficult \nprocess  since  the  building  undergoes  a  lot  of  changes  in  it's  response  because  of  environmental  and \noperational variations. Our project hence was to devise and test new methods for detecting damage in \nbuildings  from  acceleration  response  on  MATLAB.  The  devised  methods  were  even tested  for  a  few \nbenchmarks,  these  also  showed  good  results.  To  facilitate  the  process  of  damage  detection,  it  is \nuneconomical  and  inaccurate  to  use  sensors  all  over  the  building  and  hence  the  process  of  sub-\nstructuring  was  done  so  that  the  sensing  can  be just  confined  to  one  region  and  the  damage  in  the \nbuilding can be detected using limited sensors.

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: The  field  of  Structural  Health  Monitoring,  in  structural \nengineering  field,  is  gaining  strong attention  for  evaluating  damage  and  maintaining  the  structural \nintegrity of the civil engineering structures over its service life against the natural hazards such as strong \nwinds  and  earthquakes  of  high  magnitude.  The  cracks  which  are  initially  invisible to  eyes  can  be \ndisastrous leading to catastrophic failure of the whole structure. This can place the lives of many people \nat risk.  The continuous monitoring of structures is required to detect the damage in the structure at an \nearly  stage.  In  the  project, a  novel  approach  was  developed  for  the  damage  identification  and \nlocalization  for  a  beam  and  a  shear  building  by  employing  the  process  of  substructuring  using  auto \nregressive  models,  frequency  response  functions  and  finally  localized  damage  location  is  indicated  the \nform  of  Damage  Index.  This  project  also  covered  the  use  of  robust  regression  methods  to  account  for \nthe  uncertainties  (Environmental  variability,  noise,  and  temperature)  in  the  data  acquired  for  the \ndamage  identification  of  a  structure.  This  project  also  dealt  with  the  damage  localization  in  a  beam \nbased on the spectral diffusion mapping and fractal dimension. The fractal dimension developed for the \n\nbeam  also  employed  to  find  the  damage  location  in  the  plate  structure. The  developed  methods  are \ndata  driven  as  it  does  not  require  to  know  the  initial  stage  of  the  structure.  The  robust  methods  can \ndetect damage precisely. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MATLAB  \nObjectives of the project: Development of robust methods for damage identification and localization of \ndamage in the structure \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  robust  methods  to  detect  damage  in  the  beam  and  the  plate  structure \nwere  developed.  The  novel  approach  can  detect  the  damage  very  precisely.  Moreover,  the  new \ntechniques are able to identify damage in the structure even with a signal to noise ration of 30. This aids \nto  overcome  the  continuous  change  in  the  working  and  environment  condition  in  vicinity  of  the \nstructure. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The project was multi-disciplinary, a person needs to have sound knowledge \nof structural analysis as well as mathematics. Through the project, I learned to use the Machine learning \nfor damage identification. The project involved the extensive use of Numerical Methods and Computer \nProgramming which was new to me, however I learned the new techniques to apply for the project. \nDetails of papers/patents: Paper on damage identification techniques currently under review. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The project was research-\nbased, so one needs to work in a silent environment to work. The environment of Structural Engineering \nResearch  Centre,  is  perfectly  what  a  researcher  requires.  I  worked  in  the  Structural  Health  Monitoring \nLaboratory,  the  laboratory  is equipped  with  high-speed  processing  computers  which  are  essential  for \ncomputational simulations. The people in the lab were very interactive which results in new and creative \nideas.  The  regular  interaction  with  scientist  always  intrigued  me  to  go  one  step ahead  to  get  the  best \noutcomes.  There  were  times  when  I  just  reached  the  dead-end  in  the  project  not  seeing  any  progress \nbut a discussion with the scientist and the Ph.D. students in the laboratory always helped to think a new \nway out to solve the problem. The Scientists of Structural Engineering Research Center currently having \na lot  of ideas and projects, a student can work  on these projects. This not only helps a student to gain \nknowledge but also develops a culture of research. Working at SERC, I found a new zeal to work in the \narea of Research and Development. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Introduction to Finite Element Methods, Numerical Analysis, \nStructural Dynamics, Probability and Statistics, Analysis of Structures, Computer Programming \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

The project was to improve the productivity of the signa trucks from 40/shift to 60/shift. \nFirstly,  trim  line  study  was  done  in  which  various  operations  done  at  various  stations  was  seen  and \nnoted  down.  Then  time  study  was  done  wherein  time  taken  to  complete  each  operation  was  noted \ndown and workers associated with each job was also noted. Then operations which took more time then \nthe  new  takt  time  was  pointed  out  and  those  operations  were  proposed  to  be  done  on  different \nstations. stoppage time was noted down in which result showed that on an average the line stopped for \naround 15 minutes every hour. This mainly occurred at 37th station where the cab is taken to the under \nbody station. \nThis was the overview of the work done by me during ps2. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Stopwatch analysis.

Thus,  promising  to  Bolster  the  Efficiency  of  the Entire  Post \nChassis LCV Assembly Line and possibly H LCV™s Overall Performance and standing. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MOST software \nObjectives  of  the  project: An  Organization™s Robustness is contigent upon the host of divisions that \ncoalesce  seamlessly  to  attain  a  coterial  framework.  To  be  circumspect,  Simply  the  Output  or  the  sales \ngarnered might not be indicative of a firm™s footing and is definitely not a credible metric.  More  so, \nsuch  an  analysis  would  act  as  an  impediment  often  masquerading  gaping  quandaries  which  are  to  be \naddressed at dispatch. If there were to be such a Performance Metric in the first place, it must have to \nrespect the extensive Activities pursued by the firm often which cannot be analyzed under a single roof \nso to speak and has to be compartmentalized. Not withstanding, the said metric must be ideated in such \na  manner  that  it  could  ably  compare  disparate  Workstations  and  could  be  also  assimilated  in  order  to \ngather the performance of the firm on the whole. An existent metric which perfectly fits the Description \nis  Measure  of  Performance.  What  we  strive  to  achieve  is  pretty  much  simple,  TATA  already  gives  a \nleeway  of  about  240  Minutes.  So,  we  are left with 300 Minutes and even that™s pretty idealistic. 230 \ncuts out a favourable figure in the BES Grapevine and we somehow have to achieve the lofty target from \nthe existent 170. Or If Not, At least upwards of 200 which in itself seems pretty daunting.   \nOutcomes of the project: Thus the continuous efforts put on the line had finally been transformed into \nsomething which could quantify now. We had developed an action plan by scrutinizing each activity, its \nwork  content,  cycle  time,  the  operators  required and  developed  an  action  plan  considering  all  the \npractical considerations which led to a much appreciable utilization of each underutilized Operator and \nthus increasing the overall utilization as well. Yes, there were some processes like Load Body placement \nwhich had an unusually low 8% utilization but then we had already talked with BES regarding such things \nwhich  had  safety  considerations  to  be  inculcated  thus  leading  to  an  increase in  a  person  employed \nthere. These hiccups taught  to us to focus on the bigger picture of improving the  MOP by man to man \nmapping  rather  than  looking  to  satisfy  the  individual  demands  of  the  manufacturing  department  by \nincreasing the process activity time(which were having almost insignificant effect on MOP)  and the BES \ndepartment (whose guidelines were very impractical to follow).  The man to man mapping thus paved us \nthe way to increase the area wise and the overall MOP by analyzing the underutilized workforce at each \nstation  by  combining  two  or  more  of  such  processes  considering  the  feasibility,  tact  time,  workstation \n\ndifference  among a few. Getting acquainted with these  processes by spending considerable amount  of \ntime helped  us  in  our  endeavour. Also  some  of  the  processes  had  not  been  included  in  the  BES  line \nbalancing  data and  inclusion  of  these  processes  also  boosted  the  MOP.  Do  It  First  Time  Right  (DIFTR) \nInspection, which included post and pre inspection processes had not been considered and its inclusion \nincreased  the  work  content  of  such  fitment  processes  having  a  direct  impact  on  the  utilization \npercentage  and  the  MOP  of  each  area. This  project  gave  us  insights  into  developing  a  few  non-\nengineering  skills  such  as  mainly  negotiation,  which  are  highly  demanded  in  a  manufacturing  work \nposition. Although we  had some stalemate like  positions in the middle we  used the correct moves  and \nwere able to deliver a considerable increase in the MOP from around 180 to 260. Although our Proposed \nAction  Plans  shall  bear  fruit  in  the  imminent  future  we  have  nurtured  a  Framework  wherein  the \nMeasure  of  Performance  Metric  is  given  commensurate  attention  to  that  of  Achieving  the  Output,  we \nanticipate that the Management will take it up on themselves to foster their efficient functioning and be \nfrequently  in touch with the  Business  Excellence Services  and shed their animosity and doubts  as both \nthem are indeed working for a common cause that is to boost the Company™s LCV Footprint and \nundertake the most robust of Process Design and Techniques with quixotic efficiency.   \nMajor Learning Outcomes: MOST Analysis, Negotiation skills, Assembly line working \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Tata  Motors  Limited \n(Founded in 1945) is an Indigenous Multinational Automotive Manufacturing Firm based in the Financial \nCapital  of  India,  Mumbai  and  is  a  member  of  India™s  most  Influential  brand  the  Larger  TATA \nConglomerate.    A  USD  42  Billion  Organization,  it  is  a  leading  global  Automotive  Manufacturer  (17th \nOverall & 5th Largest in CV™s in the world) with a portfolio boasting of a plethora of range of Passenger \nCars, Sports  Vehicles, Commercial Buses and Trucks and State of the Art Defence  Vehicles. It is the De-\nfacto  leader  of  the  Indian  Automotive  Industry  and  is  the  5th  Largest  when  it  comes  to  the  Domestic \nPassenger  Vehicles sales. It™s On and OffRoad Footprint encompasses as much as over 175  Countries \nacross the Globe. Tata Motors Pimpri, Pune the flagship plant of TATA Motors is compartmentalized to \nallude to the production of Passenger (PVBU) and Commercial Vehicles (CVBU) separately. It espouses of \nall the facilities that TATA Motors could possibly muster up namely the Design, Manufacturing and the \nResearch and Development Centres. All of which are carried out concurrently.  With Over 60,000 strong \nEmployee base the Organizations brags of having sold upwards of 9 Million Vehicles and is credited with \nhaving upto 6,600 Sales and Service Points. The Pune Unit is one amongst the 20 locations in the world \nand   6   locations   in   India   the   others   namely   being,   Sanand,   Lucknow,   Pantnagar,   Dharwad   and \n\nJamshedpur which rolls out a plethora of different Vehicles at will.  If we were to focus on the CVBU Unit \nwhich  quintessentially  deals  with  Commercial  Vehicles,  The  Pune  plant  manufactures  a  range  of  LCV, \nM&HCV  Trucks  the  prominent  ones being ULTRA, Xenon Pickup, the vintage SFC™s and LPT Models. \nMeanwhile  drifting  our  attention  towards  the  PVBU  Unit,  a  cornucopia  of  Hatchbacks,  Sedans,  Utility \nVehicles and Stylebacks await us. Also, reportedly Tata™s principal subsidiaries the English  Jaguar  and \nLandrovers are also assembled from broken down stage. Hexa, Tigor, Zest and Tiago have now become \nhousehold names in the Indian Market.  The CVBU Unit has a Human Resource Division, a Central Office \nBuilding, Manufacturing Division, Various Part and Vehicle Assembly Shops, the ERC which takes care of \nthe Design Aspect, Business Excellence Services, Quality Division and associated divisions. It definitely is \none amongst the State of the Art Automotive Manufacturing Facilities which embraces the philosophies \nof  Lean  Manufacturing,  Maynard  Operations  Sequence  Techniques  and  of  Sustainable  Manufacturing \nthat being inculcated from its parent company™s core philosophy. Pune™s Robustness, Devoted Work \nEthic and an Innovative Visionary Approach have made it possible to be consistently among the Awards \ntwo  of  which  being  in  the  realm  of  LCA  and  Energy  Efficiency  respectively  testament  to  it™s \ncommitment to Sustainable Development. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Production Techniques -1 and 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

We were given the role of structural engineering interns. Our main job was to \nmodel, analyze and design structures according to the requirements and operating in the constraints of \nthe  IS  Code.  We  used  multiple  softwares  like  ETABS,  SAFE,  RC  DC,  Staad.pro,  Excel  sheets  to  do  the \nsame.  The  structures  we  designed  were  in  both  RCC.  And  Steel  and  some  were  even  composite.  The \nstructures  were  designed  very  carefully  with  all  the  design  loads  and  load  combinations  applied \nappropriately  and  different  material  specifications  defined  and  assigned  properly.  Then  we  get  the \nresults  for  appropriate  section  size,  percentage  of  steel,  reinforcement,  material,  etc.  And  multiple \niterations  are  ran  for  the  same  till  we  get  the  optimum  result  and  it  goes  through  multiple  levels  of \nrigorous checking and then the good for construction (GFC) drawing is issued. These steps are the basis \nin handling a project and involves multiple changes and requests from the client side which we need to \nentertain. Each small building of a large project goes through these steps.  \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): ETABS, SAFE, RC DC FE, SAP2000, Staad.Pro, Autocad, MS \nExcel \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  objective  was  to  optimally  design  high  rise  structures  at  a  low  cost  and \nmeeting all the design standards \n\nOutcomes of the project: We can now easily design High Rise Structures with the help of softwares and \nIS Codes according to clients' requests. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Fluent  in  ETABS,  SAFE,  STAAD.PRO  and  can  design  multiple  types  of \nstructures with ease in RCC and Steel.  \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  work  environment \nwas very good and professional. It was very difficult at first but the seniors were very helpful in teaching \nthe  basics  of  the  work  and  softwares  and  helped  us to  get  live  projects.  There  were  constant  sessions \nheld  for  every  one  to  learn  the  advanced  concepts  in  multiple  fields  involving  civil  engineering.  Our \nexpectation  was  to  be  able  to  design  a  complete  constructable  structure  independently,  which  was \nmore than fulfilled. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the company seniors are very considerate \nand accommodating. But after learning everything the work pressure is immense and it brings out your \nbest and the joy of hitting the deadline is amazing. All things considered Vms was a very fruitful learning \nexperience.   \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Structural Analysis, RCC and Steel Design, Structural \nDynamics, Earthquake resistant Design, Wind Resistant Design \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

An  important  feature  of  keeping  a  cap  on  these  risks  is  to  be  able  to \nforesee  the  major market  moves  which  necessitate  generation  of  Scenarios  on  our  portfolios.  In  this \nanalysis, the idea is to bump various parameters like the Spot price, the Volatility or the Correlation and \nthen see the impact of these bumps on our portfolio. Finally the drivers of our losses are figured out and \naccording to the risk limits that we allot, information is conveyed to the traders. The significance of risk \nmanagement  has  risen  following  various  financial  crisis  events  involving  collapse  of  major  financial \nentities  and  hence  being  a  part  of  a  team  like  this  helped  me  develop  an  understanding  of  the  crucial \nprocesses that are driving the trades being placed in the front office. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Regression Analysis. \nObjectives of the project: Deliver Stress Testing Scenarios \nOutcomes of the project: Helped the team in delivering the stress testing scenarios for Regulatory and \nInternal Purposes. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learnt  how  to  project  the  macroeconomic  and  market  data  for  various \nregulatory and internal scenarios \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Credit Suisse has provided \nan excellent platform for learning in the form of various Study modules, guest lecture sessions and also \nweekly meetings to discuss concepts within teams. In the initial months, many of the modules that were \nrolled out to us were mandatory. Apart from that, whatever free time was available between day to day \nwork  could  be  utilized  for  going  through  many  more  of  these  modules.  They  cover  a  huge  scope  of \ntopics from basics of financial markets to studying Exotic options and complex Option strategies. I have \nlearnt  a  lot  of  concepts  through  these  packages  not  just  pertaining  to  our  team  but  across  the  entire \nindustry.  The  guest  lecture  series  was  also  an  enlightening  experience  with  people  holding  years  of \nexperience giving their valuable time in guiding the interns. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Financial Management, SAPM, DRM \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

The  Practice \nschool  program  was  a  major  transition  from  theoretical  based  knowledge  to  a  real  world  scenario,  it \nhelped me to get a different perspective overall.

One of the best things i like was \nthe EY's internal webinars and knowledge factory portal which provided a comprehensive list and tools \nfor all the career path domains along with the previous engagements proposals. It really helped to get \nacquainted with functioning of whole management and other domains too.  My first project started with \nthe Business Model Development for a private client. And this was the first time when i actually realized \nthe true potential of MS-Excel(Power Pivot).Then the following few weeks, I spent my time learning MS-\noffice applications (Excel, Word and PowerPoint, VBA) and continued to hone these skills further down \nthe  line.  Then,  i  was  assigned  the  task  of  conducting  workshops  on  \"Demand  Side  Management  and \nEnergy Efficiency\" for circle level officials of DISCOMs (Distribution Companies) for a client, as a part of \nthe  project  .It  included  logistics  management,  project  management,  budgeting,  co-ordination  with  the \ngovernment officials.

It  was  a \nwonderful experience working with the EY. \nObjectives of the project: To conduct  capacity building workshops on \"Demand Side  Management and \nEnergy  Efficiency\"  for  the  circle  level  officials  of  DISCOMs,  Report  submission  to  client  based  on  the \nworkshops \nOutcomes of the project: Successfully Conduction of workshops,Report prepared for client based on the \nanalysis done from workshops inputs, Developed a case study for Power Scenario in State(Confidential) \nMajor   Learning   Outcomes: Project   Management,   Logistics   Management,   Business   writing   and \ncommunication skills, budgeting \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company:  The  first  two days  at  EY \nwere bit embarrassing, as this much is the time it took us to realize that #Professionalism is not what we \nthink  of. So,  the  first  day  there  we  were,  dressed  up  in  formals,  entered  the  mess  and  wow!  so  many \neyes  glued to us, felt  good!! Then came  the second day,  entered, same  attire,  but  this time  too- much \nwow! But wait, we figured it out this time. So, the reason for us being in limelight for 2 days was none \nother than our Tie! Actually, we were the only ones dressed up in perfect formals while the others were \nin  their  business  casuals. Cut  to  the  chase  now.  Working  at  EY  was  a  phenomenal  opportunity  for  me. \nThere you will get to meet up a lot of people from the different sectors including Social, Power, IT, Audit, \nTransaction etc from novice to the expert experience level of candidates. You go and talk them out for \n\nany help. You will be amazed to know how much willing they are to help you. And the best part is that \nyou  get  to  learn  a  lot  from  the  experiences  and  wisdom  of  ages  garnered  by  those people  over  time. \nMost of the members of my team were subject matter experts in their respective domains which helped \nme  a  lot  as  they  were  easily  approachable  for  any  guidance  throughout.  I  would  like  to  extends  my \nthanks to the team for their constant support and help throughout the tenure. Working with the team in \nthis learning environment has really boosted my skill sets and made this PS2 a wonderful experience. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: No relevant course done by me \n \n "

I  worked  in  Business  Advisory  in  the \nGovernment Sector in the Power and Utilities domain. The team I worked with is actively engaged with \nboth government and private clients in the renewable energy sector.  My projects dealt with two broad \ntopics: Distributed Energy Resources and Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (GRSPV). I worked \non one knowledge paper, one business proposal and multiple presentations during my tenure at EY. The \nprojects dealt with global DER markets and business model development for GRSPV penetration in India. \nI,  under  the  guidance  of  senior consultants,  was  delegated  the  duty  of  analysing  global  DER  market \nlandscapes, identifying market signals for increased uptake of renewable and consulting stakeholders in \norder  to  understand  the  challenges  faced  by  GRSPV  for  penetrating  the  Indian  market. Apart  from \nworking on reports and presentations, I was also exposed to multiple client interactions. While working \non another project, I was given the responsibility of coordinating capacity building workshops for State \nElectricity  Distribution  Companies  in  Bihar  and  Odisha.  I  was  also  given  the  opportunity  to  attend \nvarious  conferences  and  summits  related  to  the  Renewable  and  Electric  Vehicle  space.  Working  at  EY \nprovided me with great exposure to the consulting sector and provided me with immense knowledge of \nthe intricacies of the Indian power market. I would like to thank  the PS Division and EY India profusely \nfor this opportunity. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w):  Microsoft PowerPoint, Pro-Ex (proprietary EY software) \n\nObjectives  of  the  project: To  create  a  knowledge  report  that  analyses  the  global  Distributed  Energy \nResources  (DER)  Market,  the  benefits  of  DER  adoption  for  India  and  the  challenges  faced  in  increasing \nthe penetration of Rooftop Solar in India. \nOutcomes of the project: The roadmap for increased DER adoption was understood and Rooftop Solar \nwas identified as a key sector for India with regards to increasing DER adoption. The challenges faced in \nrooftop  solar  penetration  were  understood  and  various  business  models  were  analysed  and  their \napplicability were suggested. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Sector  knowledge  of  the  business  aspects  of  the  Indian  Electricity  market \nwas  gained.  Business  models  for  rooftop  solar  were  understood  in  detail.  Various  soft  skills  such as \npresentation skills, client interaction etiquettes, business writing styles etc. were learnt. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: I had a chance to complete \nmy  PS-2  at  Ernst  &  Young  LLP's  office  at  Golf  View  Tower, Gurugram  which  houses  EY  professionals \nworking  in  different  service  lines  such  as  Advisory,  Transactions,  Tax  and  Assurance. The  working \nenvironment  at  EY  is  highly  professional.  All  the  colleagues  I  had  a  chance  to  work  with  were  very \nambitious and extremely efficient. Professionals at EY work  under strict  deadlines  and work hours may \noften  be  long. Employees  are  expected  to  maintain  a  professional  demeanour  at  all  points  of  time.  In \nthis regard there are various trainings and workshops held at regular intervals which provide employees \na  chance  to  hone  soft  skills  such  as  business  etiquette,  writing  styles,  presentation  abilities  etc.  The \nculture at EY stems from  ̃asking better questions to build  a  better  working  world.  Questioning  the \nstatus quo and the reasoning behind every decision is encouraged at all levels in the organisation. EY™s \ncore values:  ̃Integrity™,  ̃Respect™,  ̃Teaming™,  ̃Courage to Lead™ and  ̃Building Relationships™ are \nadhered  to  by  all  in  the  organisation. I  expected  the  organisation  to  provide  me  with  a  platform  to \nengage  in difficult business problems and to understand first-hand how such problems are  solved. This \nwas an experience which was granted to during my tenure in the organisation. EY is a great place to gain \ncorporate  exposure  and my  time  spent  at  the  organisation  has  helped  me  gain  a  lot  in  terms  of  my \noverall development and I thank the PS Division and EY India for this opportunity. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Principles of Management, Energy Economics and Policy, \nFinancial Management, Technical Report Writing \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done during  PS-II:  The  projects  mainly  deal  with  Deep  learning  approach  for \nthe Computer Vision problem. The objective of the projects  undertaken is to develop models that  give \ndecent  predictions on the data, predominantly in the form of images. This is achieved by machine  and \ndeep  learning  methods/techniques  where  in  a  model  is  trained  on  a  major  chunk  of  the  data  called \ntraining set and validating the model on remaining data called validation set. Thus trained model then is \nused for predictions. Input images used for training as well as validation can be of various sizes, shapes \nand types  such as Black  and White images,  color images,  satellite  images  etc. Further the problem can \nbe a classification problem or the regression problem. To develop an understanding of the task at hand \n\nand  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  project,  the  concepts  of  Deep  learning  such  as  Convolutional \nNeural  Networks  (CNNs)  for  classification  problems,  Region  based  CNNs  (R-CNNs),  Fast  and  Faster  R-\nCNNs  for  regression  problems  have  been  studied.  A  few  machine  learning  concepts  such  as  model \nstructure, optimization techniques like gradient descent, bias variance tradeoff have also been studied. \nTo implement these theoretical concepts, Python language and APIs mainly TensorFlow, Keras are used. \nThe  following  are  the  projects  undertaken  during  the  internship: The  first  project  is  a  regression \nmachine  learning  problem  where  in  crop  yields  are  to  be  predicted. The  second  project  is  on  object \ndetection.Apart  from  projects,  the  following  tasks  are  also  assigned: Sessions  on  machine  and  deep \nlearning mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the entire team.  Sessions on TensorFlow API \nfor the entire team. Readings on topics such as Online Offline Learning, Reinforcement Learning etc. and \nother minor tasks as instructed by the manager. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Python  is  used  for  writing  the  code.  Open  source \ndistribution, Anaconda, is used for Python installation as well as Python interpreter. For developing the \nmodels™ architecture, APIs such as TensorFlow and Keras are used. \nObjectives of the project: To develop deep learning models for computer vision problems \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Deep  Learning  models  have  been  developed  for  the  projects.  The  projects \nundertaken  are  a part  of  the  newly  launched  initiative  by  Genpact  called  Genpact  Cora  which  aims  to \nbring in digital transformation using the AI based platform and thus to create an industry first-AI for the \nreal world. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Student  has  learnt the  following  new  concepts. Basic  concepts  of  Machine \nLearning. Idea  and  functioning  of  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  of  Deep  learning. Idea  and \nfunctioning  of  a  few  state  of  the art  models  in  Object  detection. Basic  concepts  of  Reinforcement \nLearning. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nis a pleasant one. There is no pressure on us and we are given enough freedom to explore our ideas for \nthe projects. Also sufficient time was given to learn new concepts which we hadn't studied previously on \ncampus.  The  managers  know  the  limitations  of  interns  and  thus  have  given  us  work  accordingly \nproviding  enough  space.  As  a  result,  I  think  that  we  have  performed  well  and  have  been  able  to meet \nthe expectations of the company. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: C programming, Optimization, Machine Learning, Neural \nNetworks. \n "

This  state  is  beautifully \nbestowed  with  unique  beauty  and  has  lush  green  valleys,  snow  covered  Himalayan  ranges,  welcoming \npeople,  serene  and  peaceful  environment.  Despite  of  all  the  above  factors,  there  are  many  places  in \nHimachal  Pradesh  which  are  lesser  known  and  are  unvisited.  Himachal  Pradesh  with  its  serene  and \nmesmerizing  beauty  has  no  wonder  attracted  millions  of  tourists  from  across  the  world,  but  there  still \nexist numerous unexplored destinations that call for our arrival each day of the year. There are diverse \nlocations in the small state of Himachal that are yet to be explored by the tourists similarly for Nepal, Sri \nLanka  and  Rajasthan  too.  The  underlying  reasons  are  that  either  the  regions  are  underdeveloped,  not \nsafe  enough  owing  to  mountainous  terrains  and  bumpy,  irregular  paths  or  maybe  due  to  extreme \nclimatic  conditions.  For  repository  part  availability  of  collated  information,  on  external  and  internal \nassistance  for  project  development  support  in  the  country  can  serve  as  a  vital  repository  and  an \n\nimportant catalyst for infrastructure development.

With the help of GPS Map Camera we \ndid  the  Geo  Tagging  of  all  the  Kudaghars  along  with  the  pic  of  every  Kudaghars.  We  asked  the  local \nsanitary  workers  for  the  nearby  places  names  from  where  the  wastes  are  dumped  at  the  specific \nkudaghar. With the help of Latitude Longitude App we found out the coordinate of these places. Out of \nthe 46, there were some places where the dumping is now stopped and the capacity is also zero as per \nthe VNN list. So finally after doing the survey we were left with 33 locations of Kudaghar of our interest. \nWe identified three location as Transfer Stations which includes Bakriya Kund, Bhavnia Phokhari and IDH \nGolconda.  We  marked  all  the  Kudaghars  and  Transfer  stations  on  the  map  with  the  help  of  Autocad. \nOverall it was a great learning throughout the PS. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Ms- office, Auto Distance App, GPS Map Camera. \nObjectives of the project: Tourism Development Proposal, Varanasi smart city project, figure out \ntourism tenders \nOutcomes of the project: Varanasi smart city report was submitted in Ministry. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learnt to make DPR, got exposure of real time projects and field experience. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Working condition was \nawesome.

The major project was a research project on Electric vehicles (EV) involving the \nstudy  and  analysis  of  recent  trends  and  developments  in  EV  space.  Also,  I  had  to  develop  a  statistical \nmodel in order to make projections of future values of Annual EV sales, EV market shares and EV stocks \nin  the  world's  leading  markets.  The  miscellaneous  other  projects  were  in  the  domain  of  advisory  and \nconsulting  services  to  the  clients  of  PwC.  I  worked  under  the  strategic  business  unit  of  Government \nReforms  &  Infrastructure  Development  (GRID)  in  the  Advisory  line  of  service.  My  projects  were  in  the \nenergy  sector.  The  clients  were  government  power  sector  undertakings  such  as  Madhya  Pradesh  Urja \nVikas  Nigam  Ltd.  and  electricity  regulatory  commissions  such  as  Jharkhand  State  Electricty Regulatory \nCommission (JSERC). The various projects  given to me  included preparing regulatory orders,  filing tariff \npetitions, making detailed project reports and spreadsheet models, delivering presentations etc. \n\nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): The work here involved heavy usage of Office softwares \nsuch as MS- Excel, MS- Word & MS- Powerpoint. So, a higher level proficiency in these is definitely going \nto help a lot. \nObjectives of the project: The major project  involves performing a comprehensive  study of EVs. Broad \nobjectives are to: 1.Find out the leading countries in the Electric Vehicle (EV) space and select them for \nperforming all analyses.  2. Compile all the governmental policies, regulations, incentives & subsidies for \nthe encouragement of adoption of electric vehicles in various countries. 3. Study and list all the targets \nset up by governments of selected countries, in the EV space. 4. Create a statistical model to make the \nfuture predictions of the annual sales of EVs, the market shares of EVs and the total stock of EVs in the \nselected  countries  for  the  period  2017-30.  5.  Make  all  the  required  projections  for  the  future  and \ncompare  the  future  market  shares  of  EVs  to  the  present  ones  in  all  the  selected  countries.  6.  Perform \nthe aggregation of both, the  estimates of annual EV sales as well as the  estimates of total stock of EVs \nper year in the selected countries, in order to get a global overview. 7. Provide estimates of the number \nof  chargers  required  for  the  selected  countries  in 2020  and  2030  and  compare  them  to  the  targets  for \ncharging infrastructure (if any). The objectives of other allotted projects were: 1. Development of a true-\nup  order  of  Annual  Revenue  Requirement  for  2015-16  for  JSERC,  after  obtaining  its  approvals.  2. \nAnother project involved the development of a Multi-year Tariff (MYT) order of JSERC for a period of 5 \nyears (2016-17 to 2020-21). 3. ERP Implementation at MP Urja Vikas Nigam Limited- The work involved \nsegregation and classification of hundreds of hard-copy files of the organisation into various categories \nand  sub-categories,  their  numbering  and  preparation  of  a  chart  of  classification  using  a  suitable \nsoftware. \nOutcomes of the project:  1. A comprehensive study of electric vehicles was performed, which includes \ntheir history, development, technology, types and components. \n2. The present scenario of electric vehicles around the world was analysed and the leading countries in \nthe EV space were identified for further study. \n3. The presence of charging infrastructure in various countries was studied and the availability of \ncharging infrastructure versus the stock of electric vehicles in each country was analysed. \n4. Based on collection of information from various sources, exhaustive lists of both governmental \nincentives, subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles and of the national targets in all the selected \ncountries were prepared. \n5. A statistical model was developed to project future values of annual EV sales, EV stocks and EV market \nshares in each of the countries. Analysis was done for each country individually. \n6. Finally, the predicted values of various parameters were compared with the targeted values. Suitable \nconclusions were drawn and recommendations were made based on the above. \n7. The True-up & MYT documents were successfully prepared for JSERC and the assigned work in ERP \nimplementation was successfully completed. \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: 1. Gained knowledge of various statistical tools and predictive modelling \n2. Enhanced skills in MS-Excel, MS-Powerpoint & MS-Word softwares \n3. Gained a thorough knowledge and understanding of electric vehicles, electric vehicles industry and \nthe potential of future adoption. \n4. Learned about the power generation, transmission & distribution structures of various states of India \n5. Learned about the revenue model of power generation and distribution in various states. \n6. Improved presentation, communication and other soft skills. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The projects allotted to \nstudents from BITS are generally advisory and consulting projects in government sectors such as energy, \ninfrastructure etc. The work may require one to travel to another city from the base office location. So, \none must be prepared for that. This was the case with me as I worked from the client™s location, while \nmy base office was in Gurgaon. The working environment mostly depends on the work location \n(corporate office or client™s office), city and very importantly the closest team members you are \nworking with. In my case, the team that I worked with was really very friendly and supportive. The team \nmembers gave me time to settle down. Also, I frequently used to interact with senior members of the \nteam such as Associate Directors and Principal Consultants and really got to learn a lot from them. I \nbelieve it is a very good opportunity as you are getting to interact with such senior people in the \ncorporate world so early on in your career.

The Digital Financial Inclusion going \nin whole country was understood and the data was analysed for the publication of the report. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learnt  about  the  above  mentioned  projects  and how  the  research  and \nanalysis  are  done  in  the  social  sector  companies  and  the  impact  of  these  projects  in  the  respective \nsectors. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  work  which  we  did \nmostly  was  secondary  research which  helped  us  gaining  a  lot  of  information  on  various  sectors  but  at \nthe  same  time  it  was  a  bit  monotonous  sometimes  as  we  did  not  get  to  learn  any  new  software  or \nthings. Our involvement was well taken care of and we were pushed to do good work. They should give \nmore  and  more  exposure  to  different  projects  going  on  in  the  company.  The  secondary  research  at \ntimes was a bit disorganized because of the huge amount, but it helped us gaining a lot of insights in the \nsectors.  The  company  should  give  a  little  bit  more  difficult  tasks  which  help  the  interns  learning  new \nskills so that they can use it at other companies as well. \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Not   really   but   good   knowledge   of   Data   Analysis   is \nrecommended \n \n "

We shipped the deliverable to the client and are waiting for their feedback. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: 1. Advanced  Excel  is  a  very  useful  skill  in  consulting  because  whatever \nmarket research is done, the data is saved in the form of an Excel sheet. This data is collected depending \non how deep the company must be analyzed. \n2. Presenting data is a very important skill as clients don™t want to listen huge numbers during a \npitch. They want the information to be crisp and to the point. Seeing a slide with various graphs, logos \nand the insights we derived from the data is useful during client meetings. \n3. Market  sizing  is  important  when  you  are  expecting  a  disruptor  in  the  market.  For  example, \nInternet of Things is a disruptor in the current market. To estimate how  much of the market share IoT \nwill  have,  we  need  to  first  size  the  entire  market  of  the  already  existing  IoT  market.  There  are  two \napproaches to this: Top-down and Bottom-up. In the Top-down approach, we take some companies and \ncalculate  their  R&D  spend  and  their  market  share.  Then  we  calculate the  revenue  based  on  this \npercentage  for  different  industry.  This  is  usually  done  for  industrial  reports  which  require  a  mere \nnumber.  In  the  Bottom-up  approach,  we  take  the  actual  numbers  (R&D  spend)  of  different  companies \nfrom their annual reports and then estimate how much percentage of that is going to different verticals.  \n4. There  are  projects  like  M&A  (Mergers  and  Acquisitions),  Private  Equity  and  Vertical  addition \nprojects  for  which  clients  will  extend  their  requirements  for  different  industry.  For example,  a  client \n\nwishes to acquire a company in the Automotive  industry. The client would want  to acquire a company \nwhose  employees  are  less  than  100  or  200,  revenue  less  than  10  million  dollars  and  would  prefer  a \ncompany  which  has  some  assets  or  some  intellectual  property  which  it  could  leverage.  So,  we  analyze \nthe  industry  and  make  a  list  of  10-20  companies.  We  then  present  the  client  a  deep-dive  of  each \ncompany and then provide a rating of the top 10 companies so that the  client can decide about which \ncompany to be acquire. These are some things which I learnt during my PS-II. I also learnt how to behave \nin an office, when to put forward your opinion and when not to and to adhere to deadlines. I hope this \nexperience will help me in the long run and help me grow wherever I am. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Zinnov  is  a  private \nmanagement consulting company. It was established in 2001 with headquarters in Bangalore and other \noffices  in  Gurgaon,  Texas  and  California.  They  offer  variety  of  services  in  the  field  of  management \nconsulting. They work with different clients, some of who include the world™s largest consumer \nelectronics  company  and  the  leading  producer  of  cars  and  commercial  vehicles.  Working  at  Zinnov \nmeans facing a new challenge every single day. It is difficult but also very interesting. The work culture \nof Zinnov is purely professional kindled with interpersonal nurturing and connected growth. The kind of \nprojects  we  take  up  on  an  everyday  basis  are  mainly  in  the  field  of  strategy  which  need  at  most \nattention to detail and careful segregation. \n "

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: I was a part of FEV (Formal Equivalence Verification) team in \nthe  HPG  (High  Veloctiy  Project)  group  of  Intel.  FEV  is  a  crucial  part  of  the  physical  design  flow,  which \nproves  or  disproves  the  equivalence  of  two  designs  by  using  complex  mathematical  algorithms.  The \nequivalence check could be done for RTL vs RTL, RTL vs compile, RTL vs synthesis, synthesis vs APR and \nso  on.  Intel,  so  does  any  other  chip  manufacturing  company  i  guess,  uses  milestones  to  signify  the \nprogress in their project. For each milestone we will be getting new RTL, APR, SYN which would either be \na slight or significant modification of the earlier milestone. Our job is to ensure that various stages of a \npartition  (synthesis,  APR,  rtl)  are  logically  equivalent  to  one  another.  We  used  cadence  Conformal  for \nthis purpose. The flow to check the equivalence is pretty much automated by a back-end team. Once we \nfire the flow and the runs come out, we have to see if there are any non equivalents present in the two \ndesigns.  If  so,  we  start  debugging  to  see  why  those noneqs  are  present,  setup  the  necessary overrides \nand refire runs and continue this process until we have zero NonEqs. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Cadence Conformal \nObjectives of the project: Understanding formal equivalence verification \nOutcomes of the project: I am the FEV owner of 5 partitions.

One thing that i observed from my coworkers here is \nthat  they  are  highly  competitive  and  are  always  willing  to  learn.  They  pay  extreme  attention  to  detail. \nCurrently  there  is  a  massive  expansion  going  on  the  Intel  as  a  whole  and  there  is  a  lot  of  hiring \nhappening.  Some  of  us  including  myself  were  offered  a  position  here  but  they  wanted  us  to  join  in \nJanuary,  which  obviously  was  not possible  as  it  is  against  academic  rules.  Mentors  and  Managers  here \nare inclined towards M.Tech or M.E. interns, which is to be expected i suppose as they are significantly \nmore  exposed  to  the  field  of  electronics  (  or  an  equivalent  field  you  name)  than  us  the  B.E    interns. \n\nThankfully my PS2 project was decent and i was able to contribute a considerable chunk to the ongoing \nHPG  project,  which  is  to  be  taped  in  soon.

My  PS-II  started  with  a  workshop  on \nSystem  Verilog  which  helped  me  revised  concepts  of  digital  and  analog  electronics  .Further  this \nworkshop  helped  me  gain  knowledge  about  the  use  of  System  Verilog  in  the  work  and  its  differences \nwith the traditional software Verilog used at basic level in the electronic industry. On further progressing \nin  my  PS2  I  have  learnt  many  scripting  languages  i.e  tcl  scripting  and  CShell  scripting  which  are  widely \nused  in  automation  and  implementation  of  the  HDLEnginetool  used  by  our  team.  At  the  end  I  am \ncontinuing  the  testing  of  the  tool  using  my  knowledge  of  C++  and  System  Verilog  .  I  have  written \ntestcases on System Verilog and further testing is done using C++ code. One of the main constituent of \nmy project was to deploy grid mode for testing which involved automation using Cshell script and meant \nfor speeding up the process of verification atleast by half an hour. Some of the crude suggestions from \nmy  mentor  and  guidance  from  our  practice  school  instructor  R.K  Tiwary  sir  helped  me  throughout  the \nproject  to do patient testing inorder to develop the tool. As course suggestion I would suggest  courses \nlike Advanced VLSI to be done  as disciplinary  electives. Further research work is possible in my project \nincluding  new  techniques  of  testing,  to  improve  the  tool  based  on  different  techniques  and  new \ninnovation in different operations on HDL(Hardware Description Language). A paper can be published on \nthe same work. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): CSHell scripting,tcl scripting, C++ ,System Verilog \nObjectives  of  the  project: Project  was  meant  for  testing  and  development  of  HDLEngine  Tool  which \nprovides HDL modification.  \nOutcomes of the project: On further progressing in my PS2 I have learnt many scripting languages i.e tcl \nscripting   and   CShell   scripting   which   are  widely   used   in   automation   and   implementation  of  the \nHDLEnginetool used by our team. At the end I am continuing the testing of the tool using my knowledge \nof C++ and System Verilog . I have written testcases on System Verilog and further testing is done using \nC++ code. \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learning CShell scripting, tcl scripting and CAPP(C++) are the major learning .  \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Working environment was \nsuitable  for  coding.

I have been working here for the last five months in the Automotive Software team. \nIn the initial few weeks  I got to learn and get accustomed to the work environment and developed my \nsoftware skills required for the internship.  I got to understand the concept of camera calibration which \nhelps  in  reconstruction  of  the  world  model  with  minimal  error.  This  is  very  important  because  when \nthese cameras are put into use in a self driving car, reconstructing world objects with utmost accuracy is \nneeded  for  safety  reasons. I  got  to  work  with  certain  open  source  libraries  like  Ceres,  Eigen,  LAPACK \nwhich  have  been  used  with  C++  and  one  of  my  tasks  was  to  replace  these  open  source  libraries  with \nCUDA  libraries  for  carrying  out computations  on  GPU.    The  tasks  assigned  to  me  gave  me  a  practical \nexperience  on  the  live  projects  and  as  a  result  I  got  to  learn  a  lot  more  about  the  team's  job.  I  also \nanalyzed certain auto-calibration algorithms for efficiency in order to find out which ones would help my \nteam's  cause.    All  this  work  has  helped  me  improve  my  skills  in  C  programming,  Linux  Shell  Scripting \nalong with an understanding of GIT and CUDA. The work experience gained from working here at Nvidia \nhas certainly broadened my skill set making me better equipped to fit into work life. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Ceres, cuSolver, CUDA, C++ \nObjectives of the project: To understand implementation of Camera calibration, use  of ceres library in \nthe code for camera calibration, replace ceres library functions with cuSolver functions \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Knowledge  gained  about  camera  calibration,  Autocalibration  algorithms \nanalyzed, role of ceres library observed, ceres library functions replaced with CUDA libraries \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: I  was  able  to  understand  the  concept  of  camera  calibration,  how  it  is \nimportant  and  how  can  it  be  implemented.  Autocalibration  was  studied  and  the  difference  between \ncalibration  and  autocalibration  algorithms  became  clear.  Effect  of  multiple  transformations  including \nworld  to  camera,  camera  to  rig,  rig  to  world  were  understood.  Use  of  ceres  library  in  the  calibration \ncode was documented and certain open source functions were replaced with CUDA libraries \n\nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: This internship has helped \nme  develop  an  interest  in  automotive  software.  I  would  like  to  explore  this  field  and  learn  more \nregarding  the  same.  The  team  has  always  helped  me  out  whenever  I  had  any  issue  or  whenever  I  got \nstuck  anywhere.  I  have  been  able  to  interact  freely with  all members  of my  team  anytime  I  wanted  to \ndiscuss  something.  Not  just  the  team,  all  the  employees  were  very  helpful,  and  that  has  made  the \nexperience  in NVIDIA a  pretty  enjoyable  one. I  have  learnt  a  lot  in  this  short  period  of  time  because  I \nhave been given good work which has helped me hone my programming skills. The one thing that I have \ncertainly learned during my internship here is the way to mingle with the team to get work done. As an \nintern, I am glad that I was given good work just like any other employee would get. The internship has \nplayed a major role in preparing me for work in the future.  \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: C Programming, Object Oriented Programming \n "

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: I was assigned to the advertising team in Amazon. In online \nadvertising, the  decision of which ad is to be  placed on what site  is decided algorithmically,  and hence \nthe  advertiser  doesn't  know  which  site  his  ad  will  be  placed  on.  Due  to  a  steady  increase  in  extreme \ncontent on the internet, advertisers are more concerned than before about their brand advertisements \nappearing  next  to  such  content.  Amazon,  as  one  of  the  leading  digital  advertising  networks,  has  been \nparticularly   concerned   regarding   protecting   the   brand   image   of   advertisers.   My   project   was   an \nexploratory  one  which  involved  understanding  how  brand  safety  is  currently  ensured  by  Amazon, \nassessing  the  accuracy  of  our  third-party  brand  safety  partners,  experimenting  to  determine  gaps  in \ncurrent brand safety solution and estimating the extent of blind spots in our current  solution. The first \nphase  of my project  helped in establishing that the current model of evaluating brand safety of a page \nleaves a lot to be desired and should be improved upon to ensure that our advertisers are safeguarded. \nTo  narrow  down  on  what  areas  we  should  work  on,  I  developed  a  really  configurable  and  extensible \npipeline, exploiting the AWS cloud solutions, to discover new brand unsafe websites which can be used - \nto validate 3rd party signals, create a training dataset for brand safety model training and allow user to \nexperiment and find features that can be used in the model \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Used Scala programming language and Play framework for \nenhancing  an  internal  tool.  Used  Python  for  creating  Proof  of  Concept  of  the  experimental  pipeline. \nUsed AWS Tools like AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Simple Storage Service, AWS Athena and Elastic \nCloud Compute \nObjectives  of  the  project: Finding  gaps  in  current  3rd  party  solutions,  experimenting  with  different \nappraches to fix the gaps, developing a pipeline to find websites similar in content to input URLs \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Analysis  of  current  brand  safety  systems,  Development  of  a  pipeline  to  find \nwebsites similar in content to input URLs \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: I was assigned an independent project to work on. I was thus introduced to \nhow a development project is approached from scratch. I learned how to gather technical requirements \nfrom  ambiguous  business  requirements,  translate  them  into  a  flexible,  practical  and  cost-effective \ndesign and finally break down the design to small tasks which can be tracked in regular intervals. In the \ntechnical side, I improved upon my OOP  and parallel programming skills. I was introduced to functional \nprogramming (Scala). I also worked with Cloud and distributed computing (AWS Services). \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Amazon  provides  an \nenvironment which promotes learning. You are amongst people who are enthusiastic about technology, \nare  always  willing  to  learn  and  ready  to  help.  A  lot  of  different  interesting  projects  are  going  on  in \nAmazon  which  highlights  the  amount  of  opportunities  to  learn.  PPO  chances  are  team  dependent,  but \npeople normally get one if they work towards achieving the tasks assigned to them. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOP, DSA, DBMS \n \n "

My \nproject was to explore the usefulness of quantifying website quality in advertising business metrics such \nas Click through rate, consideration rate and conversion rate. I wrote javascript and scala code to extract \nfeatures  from  websites  at  scale.  I  then    cleaned,  transformed,  augmented,  and  visualized  the  data  to \nidentify trends in performance metrics attributed by these features. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Javascript,  Scala,  AWS  Technologies  (EC2,  S3,  SQS,  SNS, \nASG), Apache Hadoop, Spark, Zeppelin, PIG \nObjectives of the project: 1. Featurize  quality of a website  and extract them, 2. Analyse/Find trends in \nfeatures across sites \nOutcomes of the project: I improved the existing feature detection algorithms, and added new features \nand  algorithms  to  extract  over  25  features  per  webpage  at  high  precision.  This  feature  extraction \npipeline is implemented at scale, and tested. The features extracted for the sites were then interpreted \nagainst  advertising  performance  metrics  to  identify  ways  to  use  these  features  in  lifting  advertising \nperformance.  Several  features  showed  interesting  and  useful  trends,  they  are  still  undergoing  further \nexperimentation before being put into production. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: The  project  required  me  to  code  in  JavaScript  and  Scala.  It  was  great \nexposure to coding in the style where both functional and object-oriented paradigm were used, played \nto  their  strengths- writing pure  functions  at  method level,  using  immutable  objects  creating  code  with \nno  side  effects,  while  using  the  OOP  to  model  the  entities,  encapsulate  data  and  modularize  code.  I \nlearnt  to  use  several  big  data  and  AWS  technologies.  I  learnt  how  to  think  like  an  SDE,  keeping  in  my \nmind  the  following  while  developing  any  product - quality,  scalability,  reusability,  benchmarking  and \nwriting unit &  integration tests. I learnt several methods of data analysis, and how to approach solving \nqualitative problems.  I also learnt several leadership and interpersonal skills. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Under the guidance of a \nmentor, I was given a project to explore from start to finish. I was given the autonomy to make decisions \non various design, tech stack and implementation details of my solution. Even though Amazon is one of \nthe largest MNCs out there, all the teams within operate as fast paced, high energy startups. This \nenriched my internship experience as I could learn and work on a lot more in my 5.5month internship \nthan I expected. The team has regular sync-ups and demos of work done so far. I set up regular bi-\nweekly meetings with the stakeholders for my project to communicate updates and incorporate their \n\nideas/advice. SDE Interns must be receptive to others, take ownership and drive the project from start \nto finish. We must also be ready to learn any technology and start developing on it ASAP. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOP, DSA \n "

For the implementation of the project, I had \n\nto learn various concepts like model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, SQL and No SQL databases and \nknowledge of REST APIs . \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): The core development was done in JAVA 8 and the testing \nfor  the  back  end  was  done  using  Mockito  and  JUnit  frameworks.  As  part  of  front-end  designing  of  this \ntool,  I  worked  on  Ruby  on  Rails.  Ruby  on  Rails  is  a  server-side  web  application  framework  written  in \nRuby,  which  is a  high-level  object  oriented  programming  language.  Rails  is  a  model-view-controller \nframework. \nObjectives of the project: Tool development for validating business rules for fraud detection \nOutcomes of the project: A complete functioning service with an integrated back-end and front-end \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Apart from learning various software related concepts, I also got a flavor of \nthe life in IT industry. It is very important to be on your toes, responsive and pro-active when it comes to \ndelivering and meeting the deadlines one estimates. I also realised how working in industry is different \nfrom  academic  projects.  In  the  IT  industry  there  is  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  correcting  the  edge  cases \nassociated with  a  given  problem.  Also, the code  is  subjected to a  large  number  of  stress  tests  to  make \nthem  as  bug-proof  in  the  future  as  possible.  The  programs  are  also  reviewed  by  various  other \nexperienced developers to reduce possibility of bugs and to maintain a uniform coding standard within \nthe  team.  Moreover,  even  while  writing  the  code,  a  lot  of  emphasis  is  laid  on  making  it  based  on  the \nindustry  standards,  easy  to  read,  at  the  same  time  exploring  about  the  advancements  in  the  coding \npractices. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Here at Amazon, the best \npart  was  that  we  were  not  given  any  kind  of  spoon  feeding.  We  were  taught  to  expect  help  only  in \nminimal  matters.  The  solution  was  not  provided  directly.  We  were  asked  to  read  and  explore  on  our \nown. It was difficult at first but ultimately this made us independent and quick at problem identification \nand  resolution.  And  this  was  the  biggest  factor  in  helping  me  transition  from  academic  learning  to \nindustrial application. PS-2 helps one to build their persona, knowledge base and interact with industry \nexperts. The experience at PS-2 - if not affect my future career prospects - has at least made me aware \nof the current industry standard and situation and that adds to better chances at scoring a workplace in \nfuture. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object Oriented Programming with JAVA, Databases, Data \nstructures and Algorithms. \n "

Apart  from  machine  learning  and  cloud  computing, \nAmazon  also  helped  me  learn  the  basics  of  software  development.  You  are  encouraged  to  write  high \nquality  code  as  every  code  change  goes  through  an  extensive  code  review  before  getting  shipped  and \nthere is a lot of emphasis on code quality and testing. Because of the scale Amazon operates at, there is \na lot to learn about designing scalable services and developing tools that allow fast iteration. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic, Data \nStructures and Algorithms, Principles of Programming Languages, Operating Systems. \n \n "

The  time \nspent  on  programming  the  solution  was  no  too  much,  however,  it  too  demanded  some thinking. The \nmajority of time was  however spent in testing the  code. Since  there was  no simpler way to ensure  the \nfull working of the code  base,  regular trips with the bot  was  made,  in order to test every  phase  of the \nsolution  build.

Some  major  challenges  are:  ï‚·  Cost  ï‚·  Scalability  ï‚·  Ease  of  installation  ï‚· \nInteroperability ï‚· Privacy ï‚· Security The framework created in this project attempts to overcome these \nchallenges by utilizing existing devices and technologies. \nThe project consists of three major parts: \n1. Hardware and it's coding: The hardware was procured from external vendor. It was then coded to be \nconfigured by mobile app and then controlled and monitored using API's exposed by CAM. \n2.  Cisco  Asset  Manager  setup:  It  is  a  Cisco  proprietary  software  where  asset  properties,  logic  for \nmonitoring and control was defined and several API's were exposed for mobile app. \n3. Mobile App: An android app was developed which would fetch floor plan, device properties etc. from \nCAM for configuring IoT assets. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): CAM,  Android,AWS,  Javascript  H/w:  Electrodragon  Wi-Fi \nIoT Relay Board \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  project  aims  to  create  a  frame  work for  installing,  configuring  and  real \ntime monitoring of large number of IOT devices over multiple geographical locations in a easy, reliable, \nscalable, cost effective and secure manner. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: In  this  project  the  basic  framework  has  been created.  The  framework \ncomprises  of  Electrodragon  Wi-Fi  IOT  Relay  Board  Based  on  ESP8266,  Cisco  Asset  Manager  and  an \nandroid  app.  This  can  be  modified  for  other  types  of  IOT  devices  and  sensors  by  replacing  the \nElectrodragon module with appropriate module. \nSome  parts  need  modifications  to  improvise  it. The  interoperability  has  also  been  implemented.  There \nare few areas which requires better abstraction to enable easy adaption for other kinds of devices. \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learning: \nTechnical skills : 1. Hardware coding 2. App development 3. Cisco Asset Management Software Suite 4. \nProtocols such as MQTT, TLS etc. \nOther skills : 1.Real world project  planning and development 2. Gaining new insight  and perspective  in \nthe field of Internet of things from experts at Cisco systems. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nwas as follows: \n1.

The existing code was in Java \nand Scala and scripting language  used was  Groovy. The  project was  purely on the  development side. I, \nafter  thorough  research  on  various  cluster  computing  frameworks  and  databases,  proposed  suitable \nplatforms  for  the  expression  engine.  Also,  I  designed  the  architecture  specifications  including  the \nexpected code flow and functionalities supported.

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: My  work  in  the  company  focuses  on  developing  Network \nModels using languages like Groovy, TOSCA, etc. for the Modelling Engine which is the micro serviceable \ncomponent  for  the  product  called  SMARTS++ which  is  an  improvement  over  the  currently existing Dell \nEMC  product  SMARTS  to  provide  broader  use  of  Auto-scaling  Microservices,  Database  Persistence  and \nCustomization  to  the  end-user  and  change  the  existing  in-memory  data  storage  to  an  actual  graph \ndatabase.   We   decided   to   go   with   Groovy   further   and   then   performed   creation   and   testing   of \nmodels/templates.  Apart  from  this,  I  got  the  opportunity  to  build  and  execute  the  huge  codebase \nthrough which I learnt the application and implementation of tools and frameworks like grade, Maven, \nTestNG, JUnit, Eclipse, etc. \nObjectives of the project: develop the architecture of network modelling engine for nextgen smarts. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  main  objective  is  to  develop the  modelling  engine(Model  Manager) \ncomponent  for  NextGen  SMARTS  product.  Collected  the  requirements  from  clients  and  then  come  for \nthe scope on which we worked. Below it contains the abstract of these requirement tags. \nClass  Definitions:-             The  Model Manager  will  define  class  structures  for  each  Entity.  An  entity  can \nrepresent  a  component  of  a  network/cloud/storage  domain.  The  classes  will  be  defined  to  support  all \n\nobject-oriented  features  and  yet  it  should  be  independently  defined  so  that  it  entity  types  can  be \narbitrarily combined to form topologies.    \nRelationships and Reverse Relationships:-     The Model Manager will define relationships that will bind \nentities  to  other  entities.  The  relationship  types  will  be  defined  in  consultation  with  the  modules  that \ninterface  with  the  Model  Manager  such  as  Discovery  Engine  and  Expression  Engine.  A  class  can  define  \nboth Forward as well as Inverse releationship between entities to complete the relationship pair.   \nRelationship Sets:-   The Model Manager must have the capability to specify  one is too many and many \nis too many  relationships between two entities through the relationshipSet keyword \nAttributes :- The Model Manager will classify the attributes of the entities using  the following keywords  \n- stored attributes will represent all attributes that are persistent in the persistence layer \n- Constant attributes have values initialised during instance creation and cannot be changed  \n-  propagated  attributes  represent  values  that  will  change  owing  to  a  problem  or  symptom  with \nrespect  to  the  entity  via  relationships  or  relationship  sets.  These  values  may  be  computed  and \npropagated based on external events.   \nBehavioural Model Attributes:- The Model  Manager will store all propagated attributes of an entity as a \nseparate data structure and will define methods to make it available to external interfaces   \nObject Model Attributes:-   The Model Manager will specify a data  structure that  would contain all \nthe  attributes  and  characteristics  of  the  entity.  The  Model  Manager  must  provide  the  necessary \ninterfaces  to  return only  the  object  model  based  on  queries.  The  Model  Manager  will  return  the \nattributes  of  the  object  model  as  a  name-value  pair  Building  Entities  and  Relationships  w.r.t  Network \nStandards:- The  Model  Manager  must  provide  frameworks  to  define  Entities  and  relationships  in \naccordance  with  the  industry  standards.    For  instance,  a  Cloud  applications  may  choose  to  create  the \nentities  and  relationships  based  on  TOSCA  standard  and  legacy  switches/routers  may  define  models \nbased on YANG/NETCONF standard  \nProvision  For  Dynamic  Modelling:-The  model  manager  must  provide  REST-based  interfaces  to  support  \nDynamic  Modelling  wherein  an  External  GUI  interface  can  create  topologies  on  the  fly  and  the  model \nmanager must be able to construct the entities and their relationships and form the object model   \n\nWeb-Based Interface:- The  model  Manager  must    make  available  REST  interfaces  to  query  the  Model \nEntities and relations for external web-based interfaces    \nDynamic Restart:-The model manager must be able to restart itself as a service when a model changes \ndynamically.  \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: For  me  the  learning  outcomes  are  so  many  like  some  of  them mentioned \nbelow:- - Learn  Professionalism - improved   communication   skills - developed   the  skills  of  time \nmanagement - learnt  various  new  languages  like  :- groovy,  tosca,  scala,  perl - working  experiences  of \nvarious cutting edge tools. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: This  company  dell  emc \nprovides ample amount of opportunities for new interns. they provide good projects for us and so much \nto learn from team and from project as well. All the teammates are very helpful. Overall work culture is \ngood  but  According  to  me  this  thing  does  not  depends  on  the  company  rather  I  will  say  it  will varies \nfrom manager  to  manager. They  provide  working  flexibilities  like  work  from  home. To  chill  there  are \nrecreational  places(24X7)  where  we  can  play  indoor  games  like  foosball,  pool,  billiards,  carrom,  chess, \ntable  tennis, etc. and also they provide  facility to play outdoor games like cricket, basketball,etc. Work \nthey  gave  me  is  as  per  my  expectation.   My  project  contribution  towards  the  product  which  is  an \nimprovement over the currently existing Dell EMC Corporation product SMARTS to provide broader use \nof Auto-Scaling Microservices, Database Persistence and Customisation to the end-user is to develop the \nwhole  independent  modelling  engine  component  from  scratch  only  using  the  glimpse  of  dependent \nmodel manager component from classic SMARTS. I learnt a lot from this practice school. Thank you PSD \nfor providing us this opportunity \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: COMPUTER NETWORKS, OOP, DSA, COMPILER \n \n "

They use deep learning to find Traffic Signs from the drive data, which is around \n98% accurate as of today. So they need to do Image Review (manually checking whether Traffic Signs are \naccurate). My project was to automate this Process of Image Review by using just the previous accurate \ndata.  At  first  it  seemed  like  a  Supervised  learning  problem,  so  I  tried  various  Supervised  and  Semi-\nSupervised Algo's focusing on unbalanced data to get accuracy of around 80-85%. Then I tried to scale \nmy models of larger data sets using AWS, but there was not much change in the accuracy. So I began the \nproject once again from scratch from a completely different approach to traverse the map using graph \ndatabase Neo4j and generating Association Rules using FP-Growth to generate rules of accuracy varying \nfrom 100% to 70%. The rules with 100% accuracy are directly being incorporated in Auto-Code and the \nrest will be used to increase pace of Manual Image Review. \nTools   used   (Development   tools - H/w,   S/w): Python,   R,   Octave,   Spark(PySpark),   Amazon   Web \nServices,UNIX, DB :[SQL, Mongo, Neo4j] \nObjectives  of  the  project: Predicting  Traffic  Sign  locations  and  thus  automating  the  process  of  Image \nReview. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Was  able  to  get  Association  Rules  with  accuracy  ranging  from 100%  to  70%, \nthe 100% accuracy rules will be directly incorporated in Auto-Code and the rest will be used to push the \naccuracy of Image Review. \n\nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Implementing  Machine  Learning  and  Data  Mining  Algo's  using  R,  Python, \nPyspark. Deploying them on Amazon Web Services. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Awesome  environment \npretty much everything(napping room,TT room, PlayStation) except for free food.

Selenium  is  a testing \nframework which  can  be  used  to  write  functions,  such  that  given  the  right  parameters,  they  would \nperform small, but often repeated tasks like opening a URL, clicking a button, sending text, etc. On this \nframework,  we  have  a  program  developed,  which  is  uploaded  on  the  server  (thin  clients).  To  this \nprogram, we provide two files- a properties file, and a test cases file. It is these files that I have worked \non.  The  test  cases  file  is  in  a  comma-separated  values  format,  and  contains the  steps  to  be  performed \n(algorithm),  along  with  the  parameters- separately  for  each  test  case.  The  properties  file  is  a  text  file \nthat contains the values of the parameters supplied in the test cases file (URLs, text, element locations \netc.).  For  each  module,  a  separate  couple  of  properties  and  test  cases  files  must  be  prepared.  For \nmaking it user-friendly, I have created a UI for this, linking the back end with the front end. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Selenium (test framework), Eclipse, Chrome \nObjectives of the project: Automation of form filling and creating a UI \nOutcomes  of  the  project: With  form  filling  not  just  scripted,  but  also  user  friendly  (thanks  to  the  UI  I \ndeveloped),  employees  at  JDA  will  save  countless  hours  of  work,  and  focus  their  energies  on  more \npressing  demands.

The  projects  were  delivered  on  time, \nrelevant training was provided and the time limits were not very stringent. So even though I was new to \ntesting,  I  faced  no  difficulty  in  picking  things  up. On  the  very  first  day,  when  the  project  teams  were \nbeing  allotted,  I was  told  that  we  could  pick  up  any  project  we  wanted  according  to  our  convenience. \nThere is something for everyone at JDA, whether you are an aspiring web designer, tester, or even if you \nare good at documentation- JDA has relevant projects. I have seen people who did not even know a bit \nof  coding  come  here,  start  from  scratch,  complete  their  projects  and  get  PPOs.  Thus,  if  you  are \ninterested in testing, or a full stack designer who needs some practical experience to hone their skills, or \njust interested in getting an IT job, but are not much aware of the basics, JDA is the way to go. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: None \n "

Market  research  may  be  conducted  by  the  company  itself  or  by  a  third-party \ncompany  that  specializes  in  the  market  research  field.  The  PS  station  I  am  currently  associated  with, \nMordor  Intelligence,  belongs  to  the  latter  category.  Within  the  pyramid  of  market  research,  market \nmodelling,  building  an  intelligence  center,  analysing  the  strategies  of  leading  companies,  forms  the \nfoundation for all the other levels. The market research reports on food and beverage I am working on \ninvolves  understanding  the  drivers  and  restraints  for  a  specific  market,  segmenting  the  topic  and \nunderstanding the major companies operating in the region. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Intelligence Centers, Modelling Sheet, Market Estimation, \nMarket  Research,  Repots,  Top  Down  Approach,  Bottom  Up  Approach,  Logical  Guesstimation,  Analyst \nViews, MS- Excel (Advanced), CAGR, Primary Research, Secondary Research \nObjectives  of  the  project: Intelligence  Centers,  in  brief,  are  a  combination  of  building  comprehensive \ndata and analysis of this data which help us in forecasting the trends of industry. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: They  contain  exhaustive  data  which  helps  one  arrive  at  various  conclusions \nthus helping them in market related decision making. The flash reports emphasize on the understanding \nof  the  market  based  on  the  analysis  done  on  the  various  segments  in  the  market  and  the  major \ncompanies operating in the market. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The scope of my current project includes an exhaustive modelling sheet with \n25-100 factors governing the final market value and analysis of the innumerable set of data available to \narrive  at  a  conclusion.  However,  the  project  is  limited  to  the  defined  scope  of  market  modelling  and \ndoes not include embedded analytics and statistical modelling which would take the project to the next \nlevel of the pyramid. Embedded analytics is the technology designed to make data analysis and business \nintelligence  more  accessible  by  all  kinds  of  application  or  user.

Non contiguous system memory support means, that the guest OS can \nbe  booted  with  any  number  of  DIMMs,  where  the  base  address  and  the  size  of  the  DIMM  can  be \nspecified  as  a  parameter.  Robustness  of  shell  scripts  involved  modularizing  all  the  scripts  and  adding \nsupport for hard failure in case of any command being failed while execution of script. Support of newer \nchips  involved  modifying  the  shell  scripts  involved  in  the  infrastructure,  which  basically  involved \nchanging  the  simulated  GPU,  VBIOS  and  chip  arguments.  Atomic  operations  support  on  infrastructure \ninvolved  making  the  read/write   operations  to  system  memory  word  separated,  instead  of  byte \nseparated  which  was  supported  earlier.  Bugs  solved  during  the  project  were,  updating  a  Perl  script  to \nconsider different remote machines until one live is found, issue in booting guest OS with two simulated \nGPUs, issue in loading Resource Manager on simulated GPU and launching guest OS (Win7 64 bit) on the \ninfrastructure. Updating a Perl script until one live is found involved keep pinging the machines in a loop, \nuntil a response is not achieved. Two GPUs couldn™t be booted, since for one GPU, some functions \nwere  being  called  which  were  not  expected  (segmentation  fault).  Issue  in  Resource  Manager  involved \nwriting   specific   values   to   specific   registers,   information   regarding   this   has   to   be   parsed   from \nconfiguration  file.  Win  7  64  bit  support  involved  attaching  debugger  (WinDbg),  debugging  for  known \nissues and getting them resolved by collaborating with other teams. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): C  programming,  Shell  and  Perl  Scripting,  GDB  (GNU \nDebugger) \nObjectives  of  the  project: Improvements  were  made  in  the  simulated  environment,  which  made \ndebugging and testing easier.

I  worked  on  developing  an  efficient  crawler  system  in  Java,  using  Asynchronous \nHTTP clients and Jsoup libraries. Apart from writing parser codes for 67+ govt tender domains, fetching \n7000+ fresh tenders every day, I also worked on designing aspects of the core crawler framework and its \noptimizations.Besides, my job also included making front-end patches using Javascript React, and CSS3. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Technologies  used  were  primarily  back-end  related, \nincluding,  and  not  limited  to,  Java,  Spring-boot,  Maven,  Redis,  Jsoup,  Asynchronous  HTTP  clients  and \nSelenium  web  drivers.  Also  GitHub  was  used  extensively  for  code  collaboration  purposes,  and  the \nstandard Javadocs for the documentation part. \nObjectives  of  the  project: At  OFB,  the  objective  of  this  project  was  to  develop  an  efficient  crawler \nsystem  that  would  fetch  tender  data  and  information  from  the  govt.  websites,  and  then  serve  as  the \nback-end  database  for  company's  new  web  product  BidAssist.    BidAssist  is  a  new  generation  state-of-\nthe-art  Lead  Management  System  that  empowers  OFB's  new  businesses,  en  route  also  making  the \ncompany  India's  largest  non-govt,  non-profit tender  aggregator.

The  office  doesn't  treat  interns  well  and  interns  are  often \noutcasted from all the company happenings. The behavioural etiquettes of the CTO are a sheer disgrace, \nand interns are often verbally and severely bashed for even company's own faults and mismanagement. \nDerogatory  remarks  on  one  intern  went  as  far  as  their  family  backgrounds  one  time.Besides  the \ncompany's   way   of  managing   things   is   largely   haphazard   and   utterly   unorganized, and   no   clear \nobjectives/targets are ever set.

The  app  has  its  frontend \nwritten  in  AngularJS  and  the  backend  written  in  Flask.  So,  I  had  to  learn  these  technologies  and  use \nthem to redesign the app. The second project involved redesign of the backend architecture which was \na  monolith  to  a  microservices  based  one.  This  involved  the  use  of  Docker  for  creating  containers  and \nKubernetes to be used as the orchestration platform for the docker containers. The concept behind the \nmicroservices arcitecture, their uses, the communication between different services was something that \nhas to be done. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): AngularJS, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes \nObjectives   of   the   project: For   the   first   project   the   objective   was   to   completely   redesign   the \nmanufacturing  app  of  the  company.  The  objective  of  the  second  project  was  to  refactor  the  backend \narchitecture to microservices architecture from the current monolith one. \nOutcomes of the project: The outcome of the first project was a much better, cleaner, stable and more \nstreamlined manufacturing app for the company which led to increased efficiency of the manufacturing \nenvironment. The outcome of the second environment was that \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: The    main  takeaway  was    to  actually  work  on  these    technologies    in    real  \nlife.  Identifying  points  of  failure,  optimizations  to  achieve  speed up  in  data access,  using version \ncontrol to make  changes  to  a  large  repository,  adopting  best  practices  for  software development in \ngeneral were some of the key learnings. Learning  about  the  workflow conceptualizing  and  planning  a  \nproduct,    writing  clean,  modular  code    with  documentation,    pushing    it    to    production    post    peer \nreview  and  monitoring  the  performance  to  identify issues. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nis  highly  friendly.

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II:  During  my  internship  at  Siftery  I  was assigned  three  major \nprojects.The objective  behind this project  is to generate a real time mapper on sitestacks  that can in a \nfew minutes crawl a particular url for the stack technology being used and generate a response for the \nuser. The mapper will be coded on a separate server which will act as an external api for sitestacks. The \nmapper has to be extensive and detailed in its response while maintaining a low latency. By introducing \nthis feature and a products page which will cater to the need for product vise data for users, we hope to \nmake sitestacks a very promising Siftery product. Another project was focused on increasing the quality \nof Siftery data and their Graph Universe. The retry logic was a sort of a look back mechanism where the \ndata from previous crawls were compared and any incoherent data found was recrawl to avoid any false \n\npositives. The  third  and  the  last project  dealt  with  reducing  the crawl  time  of  the  Company.  The \ncomplete  web  crawling  took  about  a  week  to  complete  and  the  project  objective  was  to  reduce  this \ntime. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Rails 5, PostgeSQL, Mongo DB \nObjectives  of  the  project: Working  on  the  web  crawl  architecture  of  the  company,  thereby  making  it \nefficient and fast. \nOutcomes of the project: As a result of the work done, the crawl time was reduced significantly and the \nGraph quality was enhanced. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: After the completion of my internship at Siftery, I can say without doubt that \nI  have  gone  on  to  become  a  better  programming,  a  team player  and  most  importantly  a  better \nprofessional. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: PS  II  was  great  learning \nprocess for me. Working at Siftery was a great experience as we shared a lot responsibility and sense of \nownership in the area we started working. In the past  few months I have  pushed thousands of lines of \ncode into production and it feels amazing to see, the features I worked on being used by so many people \naround the world. At Siftery, they treat you like full time employees and give you a lot of responsibility \nfrom day 1. It's pretty challenging and at  same  time fun too. The start  up is one of the  fastest growing \ncompanies  in  India  and  I  would  recommend  tech  enthusiasts  to  definitely  consider  it  as  an  internship \noption. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOP, DBMS, CP \n \n \n \n"

Based  on  TestNG,  a \ncommon unit testing framework, similar to Junit, but better in our use case, with the following features: \n1. Allows  Developers  to  group  tests  by  domain,  service  &  ability  to  execute  the  domain/service \ntests independently. \n2. Ability  to  define  priority  (Not  the  same  as  in  TestNG),  that  categorizes  the  tests  as  P1/P2/P3, \nenabling decisions when a component is ready to deploy or would need additional approvals. \n3. Custom    reports    generated,    that    would    cater    to    the    needs    of    different    audience \n(Executives/Managers/Developers) which are, of course, much better than the default TestNG report. \n*  ETL: I was give one ad-hoc task for data pulling, transformation and loading. Secondly, I modified the \nexisting ETL pipelines for better code hygiene, code coverage and removing existing potential bugs. \n* POC on database selection for search: I was given a task to pick a database which can perform well in \nwrites,  pointed  queries,  aggregations  and can  be  used  for  text  search.  The candidates  were  MongoDb, \nCassandra, ElasticSearch and Solr. I tested for the relative writes per second, response time for pointed \nqueries and simple aggregations. ElasticSearch came out on top and has a huge adoption rate nowadays. \nI developed related micro-service and corresponding mapping/indexing for accurate free text search. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Looper  (based  on  Jenkins),  Hygieia  (publishing  code \nresults), Sonar (for generating code hygiene reports), OneOps (cloud based VMs for deploying artifacts), \nintelliJ Idea, Atom and Eclipse for development, GitHub as VCS, OpenStack Swift for Object Store, Docker \nfor Containers and CCM for Central Configuration Management. \nObjectives of the project: The goal of smart forecasting project was to better forecast the sales of fast-\nmoving/perishable  items  to  avoid  over/under  stocking,  reduce  wastage  and  hence,  increase  revenue \ngeneration for Walmart US stores. \n\nOutcomes  of  the  project: Developed  micro-services  and  regression  tools  for  the  Smart  Forecasting \nproject. Learned better and cleaner coding in Java, React JS and Scala. Learned how search engines work \nand how to modify them for our own use. Developed a sense of punctuality and responsibility. Learned \nabout the understanding of actual scope of a production-based task. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learned  about  open  source  search  Engines  based  on  Lucene,  mainly \nElasticSearch and Solr. Understood the importance and implemented Design principles. Mechanisms of \nRegression (End to end functional) testing. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Walmart GTS as a whole is \na  great  workplace  where  work-life  balance  is  a  priority  for  the  leadership.

I  had  taken  courses  in  Objected  oriented \nprogramming and Operating systems as part of disciplinary  electives. These courses  helped me  a lot  in \nunderstanding   various   other   concepts.   During   this   period   I   have   explored   topics   like   Database \nmanagement systems and Networking. I was fortunate enough to intern in a dynamic team where I was \ngiven  every  opportunity  to  learn  the  technologies  used.  I  was  given  sufficient  time  to  grasp  new \nconcepts.  The  team  was  receptive,  and  time  and  again  helped  me  in  all  the  challenges  I  faced.  All  the \ntrainees and new joinees in the GIF department were given daily sessions on what every component in \nGIF does. It was  during these sessions that  I was able to learn a lot  about the functioning of the entire \nGIF as a whole. It was amazing to witness how every team collaborates to fulfill orders to the customers \nkeeping the lowest price on the block• commitment. The exposure given has been great. I was the only \nintern   to   provide   production   support   during   the   Walmart   holiday   season.   My   experience   here \n@WalmartLabs has been amazing.

I  improved  the  Summariser  by  using  a  technique  called \nAided  Summarisation.  LexRank  Summarisation  technique  is  used  for  Extractive  summarisation  and  the \nsummary  is  enhanced  using  sentence  ranking  algorithm  based  on  title  matching  score  and  content \ndiversity score calculated by sentence  similarity algorithm. The sentence  similarity  algorithm is created \nusing gensim word2vec model. \nObject  Detection:- The  Object  detection  is  done  using  tensorflow  pre-trained  models  trained  on  the \nCOCO dataset that consists of 80 object categories. The videos are converted into a list of numpy arrays \nusing  the  moviepy  module.  Scene  detection  is  done  on  the  video  to  reduce  the  time  taken  by  the \ndetection algorithms and is performed using the ffmpeg library. The video is converted into a series  of \n\nsub- clips  that  can  be  loaded  into  memory.  The  detection  algorithms  are  run on  these sub-clips  and  at \nthe end they are concatenated using the moviepy library. \nFace Recognition:- The system architecture is divided into three processes-  Face Detection, Converting \nDetected  Faces  into  a  format  that  are  easily      comparable  to  the  faces  stored  into  the  dataset,  actual \nrecognition by similarity   calculation. Face Detection is done using MTCNN. Face Embeddings is created \nusing FaceNet. Embedding LookUp is done Clustering algorithm. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Anaconda, Amazon Lambda, Amazon EC2 instance, Python, \nTensorflow, Keras \nObjectives of the project: Article Summarisation:-The GIstAI platform ,companys key product is a video \ncreation tool developed for news companies  to convert  their articles into news videos.

The   summariser  was   not   working   properly   for   long articles   and \nsometimes  didnt  render  appropriate  results  and  needed  improvement.  Object  Detection:- Object \nDetection  is  quite  popular  in  the  industry  but  serving  good  models  as  an  API  to  clients  for  them  to \nupload videos and get object detections is where the problem starts. Face Recognition:- The objective is \nto develop a Largs Scale Facial Recognition System that is able to recognise identities efficiently from a \ndatabase pool of millions of faces. \nOutcomes of the project: Article Summarisation:- The system is live on the GISTAI Platform and is able \nto render good summaries. \nObject  Detection  :- The  object  detection  is  model  is  live  on  the  Google  Cloud  ML  Platform  and  is  able \ndetect objects out of 90 categories.  \nFace  Recognition:- The model is linearly scalable and is able to look up the database  and recognise  the \nfaces out of a pool of millions of faces.

			"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Data  analysis  of  the  profile  of  aluminium  sheets  using \nprocess parameters from the hot rolling mill. Profile is a technical term used to describe the deviation in \nthickness  across  the  width  of  the  sheet.  Profile  control  is  important,  especially  for  sheets used  in  the \n\nprinting  industry.  Undesirable  errors  will  render  the  sheet  unusable.  Using  scikit-learn,  the  machine \nlearning  library  in  Python,  I  determined  the  dominant  parameters  affecting  the  profile  and  made  a \nregression model to predict the value of profile, given a set of input parameters. \nTools  used  (Development tools - H/w,  S/w): SQL; Python  (numpy,  pandas, matplotlib  and  seaborn  for \nconstructing plots, scikit-learn for machine learning);Microsoft Excel. \nObjectives  of  the  project: To  determine  the  dominant  parameters  affecting  the  profile  of  aluminium \nsheets. To make a regression model to predict the value of profile, given a set of input parameters. \nOutcomes of the project: Met the objectives. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Statistical  analysis  of  an engineering  problem;  Procedure  to  follow  to \npresent data; SQL and Python programming \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Very  supportive  work \nenvironment. Mentor is very  helpful and patient. Expected to get a project  working on the plant  floor, \nbut  got  a  multidisciplinary  project  topic  that  included  aspects  I  learnt  in  my  Mechanical  Engineering \ncourses  at  BITS  along  with  machine  learning  and  statistical  modelling  using  Python  programming. \nColleagues and staff are friendly and help in settling down in the beginning. Main drawbacks are that the \nplant is located in a remote location, especially for Bombay residents and the working hours are longer \nthan I would like (9-5:30 Mon-Fri and 9-1 on Sat). \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Production Techniques I & II (the part related to rolling \nprocess).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
